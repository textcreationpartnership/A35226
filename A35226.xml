            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVer ſince Almighty God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to ſubdue the Earth, there have not wanted Heroick Spirits in all Ages who have adventured their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Perſons to make new Diſcoveries of the unknown Parts of the World, and many have induſtriouſly indeavoured to find out the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit thereof, ſome ſtriving to effect it by Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Concluſions and School demonſtrations; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with much more certainty have added their own Experience and Travels thereto, all whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved much commendation in their ſeveral times. For if he who ſurveys only ſome few Mannors or Lordſhips ſhall be thought worthy of ſome reward both for his Pains, and Skill, how much more are the Travels of thoſe Famous Worthies to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized who have beſtowed their Studies and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in meaſuring out and incompaſſing this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt immenſurable Globe; Neither is this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on valuable here, which is of force in private Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions;

               <hi>Whoſe Land do you Survey?</hi> Since the Vaſt Ocean is the Lords alone, and is by him left free as ſufficient for the uſe, and large enough for the Induſtry of all men.</p>
            <p>Among theſe Gallant Adventurers none is more renowned than our preſent Heroe Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who may be a Pattern to ſtir up all Heroick and active Spirits in theſe days to benefit their Prince and Countrey, and immortalize their names by the like Noble Attempts, who by firſt turning up a furrow about the whole World hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that went before him. Of whoſe Worthy Travels and Exploits there having not hitherto been publiſhed any juſt or exact Account; I have Collected all I could any where meet with upon this Excellent Subject and reduced it into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Method, to make it the more uſeful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to my Countreymen, whom as I have oft heretofore endeavoured to oblige by the like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and I hope not unprofitable Diverſions, I ſhall ſtill continue the ſame according to my Ability and Power.</p>

               <p>At the entrance into the Bay Admiral <hi>Drake</hi> intended to have gone aſhoar with only a few in his company ſince he knew that no <hi>Spaniards</hi> dwelt within thirty five mile of the place, that is at <hi>Tolou</hi> Eaſtward, and <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to the Weſt, when rowing toward the ſhore he ſaw a ſmoke in the Woods near the place where he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56659:8"/>
had frequented laſt year, and therefore taking more ſtrength, with Guns and other weapons, ſuſpecting ſome Enemy near, he landed, where he found evident marks that Captain <hi>John Garret</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> had been lately there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought thither by ſome who were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Drake</hi> in that Voyage, he had left a Plate of Lead faſtned to a very great Tree, which four men together could not fathom, on which theſe words were ingraven, <hi>Captain</hi> Drake, <hi>if you fortune to come to this Port make haſt away; For the</hi> Spaniards <hi>which you had here with you the laſt year have betray'd this place, and taken away all that you left here; I departed from hence this preſent</hi> 7. <hi>of</hi> July 1572. <hi>Your very Loving Friend</hi> John Garret.</p>
               <p>The ſmoke they ſaw was from a Fire made by <hi>Garret</hi> at his departure in a great Tree, which had continued burning at leaſt five days before their Arrival; Notwithſtanding this warning, <hi>Drake</hi> reſolved to build his Pinnaces in this convenient Port; Which they finiſhed in ſeven days after their coming upon the Land, by the help of ſome large Trees grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there which were near forty yards about, being white and as heavy as <hi>Braſile</hi> Wood; There came now into the ſame Bay an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bark of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight, James Rawſe</hi> Captain, with thirty men, ſome of whom had been there with <hi>Drake</hi> the year before; They brought in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Carvel or Advice-Boat
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56659:9"/>
bound for <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and a Shallop with Oars taken at <hi>Cape Blank,</hi> and being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Drakes</hi> deſign, they joined with him therein; <hi>July</hi> 22. they ſailed out of this Harbor for <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and coming within three days to the <hi>Iſle of Pinos</hi> took two Frigots laden with Plank and Timber from <hi>Nombre de Dios;</hi> The <hi>Negro's</hi> aboard informed them of the preſent State of the Town, and that ſome Souldiers were dayly expected from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Panama</hi> to defend it againſt the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons,</hi> a black people who about eighty years paſt fled from the cruelty of their Maſters the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and grew ſince into a Nation under two Kings of their own, one inhabiting Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the other Eaſt in the way from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> who had almoſt ſurprized the Town ſix weeks before.

               <p>Leaving then his three Ships and the Carvel with Captain <hi>Rawſe,</hi> and putting fifty three men with Targets, Pikes, Fire-Pikes, Muskets, Bowes and Drums into his four Pinnaces,

                  <hi>Rawſes</hi> Shallop making one, he parted from his Company and in five days landed in the Iſland of <hi>Cativaas</hi> about 25 Leagues diſtant, and having muſtered and armed his men betimes in the morning, he exhorted them to be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and couragious, repreſenting to them the greatneſs of the Booty, the weakneſs of the Town, and the hope of prevailing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing the wrongs he had received, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince he was accompanied with men of as much reſolution as himſelf, and at ſuch a time as they were very likely to be undiſcovered; In the afternoon they again ſet Sail for <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and in the Evening reacht the River <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi> and lay cloſe to the Shore all day to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diſcovery from the Watch-houſes; In the night they rowed hard till they came into the harbour under the high land, reſolving after they were refreſht, to attempt the Town next morning by day break; but Captain <hi>Drake</hi> obſerving that his men from the report of the <hi>Negro's,</hi> ſeem'd to apprehend the danger of this attempt becauſe of the greatneſs and ſtrength of the Town, to prevent their fears he took the opportunity of the riſing of the Moon that night, perſwading them that it was the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day, whereby they came to the Town above an hour ſooner than was at firſt propoſed, which was about three in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it happened that a Ship of ſixty Tuns, lately arrived from <hi>Spain</hi> with Canary

Wines and other goods came juſt into the Bay, having not yet furled her Sails, who eſpying the Pinnaces ſo well Manned and Oared, ſent a Gandeloe to give notice to the Town, which <hi>Drake</hi> perceiving got between her and the Town, forcing her to the other ſide the Bay, ſo that he landed without the leaſt reſiſtance, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only one Gunner upon the Fort, with ſix great braſs Guns on Carriages, and ſome whole and Demy Culverin, which they inſtantly diſmounted; The Gunner fled and gave the Town the alarm, who were uſually upon their Guard, by reaſon of the diſturbances the <hi>Symerons</hi> often gave them, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now perceived by the cryes of the People, the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the great Bell, and Drums beating up and down the Town.</p>

from thence to ſtop the Alarm-Bell which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Ringing all this while, but the Church being ſtrong built, and firmly Lockt and Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they could not get in without firing it, which the Captain abſolutely forbid; Mean time two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> being taken in the flight, were commanded to direct them to the Governors houſe, where uſually all the Mules who brought the Kings Treaſure from <hi>Panama</hi> were unladen, though the Silver only was kept there, the Gold, Pearl, and Jewels, when entred by the Kings Officer being carried from thence to the Treaſury hard by, which was very ſtrongly built of Lime and Stone for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it; Coming to the Governors, they found the great door where the Mules unload juſt opened, a Candle lighted on the Stairs, and a very fine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe ready ſadled either for the Governor or ſome of his Family; By means of this light they ſaw a vaſt heap of Silver in the lower Room conſiſting of Bars of Silver piled up againſt the Wall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty foot in length, ten in breadth, and twelve in height, each Bar between thirty five and forty pound weight. At ſight hereof Captain <hi>Drake</hi> gave ſtrict charge none ſhould touch a Bar of it, but ſtand upon their guard, the Town being full of people, and there being in the Kings Treaſury near the Water-ſide more Gold and Jewels than the four Pinnaces could carry, which he told them, they ſhould inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Returning back to the Market-place news came their Pinnaces were in danger to be ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Souldiers and Townſmen, of which they had intelligence by one <hi>Diego</hi> a <hi>Negro,</hi> who during the skirmiſh came to the Pinnaces and inquired whether they belonged to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Drake,</hi> and thereupon deſired to be taken aboard, which was done though he had ſeveral Shot made at him from the ſhoar; By him they had notice that about eight days before their arrival the King had ſent thither an 150 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſecure the Town againſt the <hi>Symerons,</hi> which was likewiſe full of other People, this was the rather believed as agreeing with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Negro's</hi> taken formerly at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Pinos; Drake</hi> therefore ſent his Brother and <hi>John Oxnam</hi> to diſcover the truth, who found the men aboard the Pinnaces much frighted with the great Troops they ſaw running about with lighted Matches, and Weapons crying, <hi>Que Gente? que gente? Of what Nation are they? What Countreymen are they?</hi> who not having been at the conflict at the Market-houſe, but coming thither from the furtheſt parts of the Town, (which was as large as <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) came many times near them, and finding they were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> diſcharged their Guns at them and ran away. After this fell a terrible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56659:12"/>
ſtrom of Rain, Thunder and Lightning with ſo much violence, as uſually happens in thoſe Countreys, that before they could ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Treaſure-houſe ſome of their Bow-Strings, Match and Powder were wet, which cauſed much diſturbance among them, which <hi>Drake</hi> perceiving told them, <hi>That he had brought them to the mouth of the Treaſure of the World, which if they did not now gain, none but themſelves were to be blamed;</hi> After this the ſtorm, having continued near an hour, ceaſing, to prevent the fears of his men, and the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Enemy, he commanded his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>John Oxnam</hi> and their company to break open the Treaſure-houſe, and the reſt to follow him to the Market-place till they had finiſhed the buſineſs they came about; As <hi>Drake</hi> ſtept forward his Strength, Sight and Speech failed him, and he began to faint for want of Bloud, which he then perceived had iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in great quantity from a wound in his Leg in the firſt encounter, and which he hitherto had concealed leſt he ſhould diſcourage his Company, or tempt them to forſake him, many having already got conſiderable booty; He loſt ſo much Bloud filling his very footſteps on the Sands therewith, that his men were much troubled, not thinking it poſſible he could live after ſo great an evacuation, giving him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſomewhat to drink which recovered his Spirits, they bound up his wound with his Scarf,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56659:13"/>
and perſwaded him to go aboard for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he abſolutely refuſed, doubting whether ever he ſhould have the like opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that joining force and intreatys together, they carried him into the Pinnace, and the whole Company being imbarqued by break of day <hi>July</hi> 19. many of their men, beſides <hi>Drake,</hi> being wounded, though only a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petter ſlain, they reſolved to be gone, taking the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship of Wines along with them for relieving their Captain and themſelves, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got out of the Harbor, the Towns-men remounting one of their great Guns ſhot at them, but without damage, ſo that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off their prize to an Iſland two Leagues thence called the <hi>Iſle of Victuals,</hi> where they ſtaid two days to cure their wounded men, and refreſh themſelves in the Gardens they found there, abounding with all ſorts of Roots, Fruits, Poultrey, and other Fowls no leſs ſtrange than delicate.</p>
               <p>Soon after their Arrival a Gentleman, who belonged to the Garriſon lately ſent to the Town came to them, proteſting the intent of his coming was only to ſee and admire the courage of thoſe who with ſo ſmall forces had made ſo great and incredible an attempt, that at firſt they feared they had been <hi>French,</hi> but perceiving them by their Arrows to be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their fears were abated, ſince they were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that though they took their Treaſures, yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56659:13"/>
they would uſe no cruelty to their Perſons, but though this Gallant pretended his viſit was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to honour their Virtues, yet they were after ſatisfied that he came directly by the Governors command to diſcover whether their Captain were the ſame <hi>Drake</hi> who had been the two laſt years on their Coaſts, whom the Towns-men affirmed they knew very well, and who had always uſed them kindly, and becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were wounded with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, he deſired to know whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had poyſoned them, and how they might be cured, laſtly what Proviſions they wanted, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor promiſing to ſupply them to the utmoſt of his power; the Captain though he judg'd this Souldier only a ſpy, yet treated him civilly, and returned this anſwer to his demands; <hi>That he was the ſame</hi> Drake <hi>whom they meant, that it was never his cuſtom to poyſon Arrows, that their wounds might be cured with ordinary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the Iſland they were upon was ſufficient to ſupply all his neceſſities, and that he only wanted ſome of that excellent commodity of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which that Countrey yielded for the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Company; He therefore adviſed the Governor to look about him declaring that by the help of God he was reſolved before his departure to reap ſome of that golden Harveſt which they got out of the Earth, and ſent into</hi> Spain <hi>to trouble all the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this unexpected anſwer the Gentleman
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56659:14"/>
replyed, <hi>Pray Sir may I without offence ask what was the cauſe of your leaving the Town now, where there was above three hundred and threeſcore Tun of Silver, ready for the Fleet, and a much greater quantity of Gold lockt up in Cheſts in the Kings Treaſury?</hi> The Captain giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a true account of his unfortunate wound and unwilling retreat aboard, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> acknowledged they had no leſs reaſon in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than courage in attempting, and that it was more neceſſary for the Town to provide for their own defence, than to ſet out any Ships to offend the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> After this he was diſmiſt with gifts from the Captain to make his report to the Governor, proteſting he never received ſo much honour from any Perſon in his life; the <hi>Negro</hi> aforementioned confirmed all that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> related of the vaſt Treaſures in the Town, adding, <hi>That they might have Gold and Silver enough if they would make uſe of the</hi> Symerons, <hi>and that he would venture with them if the Captain would undertake his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince they hated him for betraying ſeveral of them into the hands of their Maſters, and that he knew they had a great reſpect for the name and Valour of Captain</hi> Drake; Hereupon they reſolved to leave that Iſland as neither ſafe not healthy, and the next night arrived at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Pinos</hi> or <hi>Port Plenty</hi> where they had left their Ships, from whence <hi>Drake</hi> ſent his Brother and <hi>Elles Hixon</hi> to the Weſt-ward to ſearch the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <hi>Chagro</hi> where he had been the year before, and deſired a further diſcovery ſince it ran Southward within ſix Leagues of <hi>Panama</hi> near a little Town called <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> whence all the Treaſure uſually brought by Mules from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama</hi> was ſhipt down this River into the North Sea, the tyde not running up far into the land, ſo that it requires three days to go up againſt the Stream.</p>
               <p>When they came to their Ships <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. Captain <hi>Rawſe</hi> deſpairing of the hoped-for-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and their ſecurity on thoſe Coaſts being now diſcovered, was upon his deſire freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, after the return of the Pinnaces from ſearching the River <hi>Chagro,</hi> the reſt continuing in the <hi>Iſle</hi> about ſix days when it was concluded that <hi>Drake</hi> with his two Ships and three Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces ſhould ſayl to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which they did in ſix days, the calms they met with much hindring their ſpeed, attempting nothing by the way neither at <hi>Tolou</hi> nor elſewhere; <hi>Aug.</hi> 13. their two Ships archord between the Iſlands of <hi>Careſha</hi> and St. <hi>Bernards,</hi> the Captain bringing the Pinnaces about into the Harbor of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> where at the entrance he found a Ship at anchor with only one old man aboard, who upon demand anſwered, <hi>That the reſt of his Company were gone aſhoar in a Gondelo that Evening to fight about a Young Lady,</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, <hi>That two hours before night a Pinnace ſailed ſwiftly by with Oars inquiring

whether any</hi> French <hi>or</hi> Engliſh, <hi>had been lately there, and being anſwered, none, they bid them look to themſelves, and that within an hour after this Pinnace was come to the further ſide of</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena, <hi>many great Guns were diſcharg'd, whereupon one going to the top Maſt eſpyed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships and Veſſels coming into the Caſtle;</hi> This report the Captain credited ſince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had heard the Ordnance, and perceived they were now fully diſcovered, yet having notice by this old Mariner, that a great <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ship newly unladen lay in the next Point, bound next morning for St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> they took him aboard their Pinnace to verify his information, and coming near the ſaid Ship they askt whence they came, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> replyed, from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they abuſed and railed at them, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding their words inſtantly boarded her, though with ſome difficulty by reaſon of her height, ſhe being 240 Tun; Having entred the Deck, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiving they had taken poſſeſſion, got all into Hold with their arms, except two youths, when finding no danger from the Enemy, they towed the Ship without the Iſland into the Sound, juſt before the Town though out of reach of their great Guns.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Town having Intelligence hereof by their Watch, took the alarm, rung out their Bells, and ſhot off about thirty Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and divers Horſe and Foot came down

which he muſt needs do him aboard his own Ship, which was in the middle of the ſecond watch, to go privately down into the Well of the Ship, and boar three holes as near the Keel as poſſible, laying ſomewhat againſt it to prevent the noiſe of the Water entring in; <hi>Moon</hi> was aſtoniſht to hear him propoſe the loſs of ſo good a Ship which was his own, new, ſtrong, and in which he himſelf had before made two rich and gainful Voyages, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if his Brother, the Maſter, or any of the Saylors ſhould know of ſuch a fact, they would certainly kill him, but the Captain ſatisfying him of the neceſſity of it, and aſſuring him of ſecreſie, till they ſhould all be glad of it, he undertook and perform'd it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Next morning <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. <hi>Drake</hi> going early a fiſhing in his Pinnace, and falling aboard the <hi>Swan</hi> calls for his Brother to go with him, who riſing haſtily, replyed, he would inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or attend him if he pleaſed to ſtay; The Captain perceiving the buſineſs done, would not haſten him, but rowing away, careleſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, <hi>why their Ship was ſo deep in the Water;</hi> Upon which his Brother ſent to the Steward to know whether there were any Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her, or what might be the cauſe, the Steward ſtepping haſtily down ſuddenly his uſual ſcuttle was wet up to the waſt, and getting up again with much affright, cryed out, <hi>The Ship was full of Water;</hi> There was no need

of haſtning them, ſome went to the Pump, and others to ſearch for the Leak, which the Maſter obſerving inſtantly followed his Brother, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him of the ſtrange accident befallen them that night, that whereas they had not Pumpt in ſix weeks before, they had now ſix foot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hold, and therefore deſired to be excuſed from fiſhing to ſearch and remedy the Leak, and the Captain offering his aſſiſtance his Brother anſwered, they had men enough aboard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to continue his fiſhing that they might have part thereof for dinner; His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returning found the Company had taken much pains, but had freed the Water very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet having much love to the Ship (as <hi>Drake</hi> foreſaw) they uſed their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence till three in the afternoon, when perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though they had aſſiſtance from the Captains Ship, yet they were not able to free above a foot and half of Water, and were very unlikely to find the Leak they were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and deſired <hi>Drakes</hi> advice how to remedy it, who thereupon perſwaded them to take their goods out of her and then ſet her a fire to prevent her falling into the enemies hands, that himſelf would Sail in the Pinnace till he could provide ſome handſom Frigot, and his Brother ſhould be Captain of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral together with the Maſter; This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſeem'd ſtrange at firſt, yet was inſtantly put in execution that night, <hi>Drake</hi> having

by <hi>Carthagena</hi> out of ſight, and coming within two Leagues of the River they landed on the Main Land Weſt-ward, and ſaw much Cattel, and finding ſome <hi>Indians</hi> who kindly demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>What they wanted,</hi> they deſired freſh Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als which the <hi>Indians</hi> preſently furniſht them with, taking what Cattel they needed with ſo much eaſe that they ſeemed to have an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command over them, whereas theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would not ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to come near them, the Captain, as uſually before, giving them ſuch things in exchange as much contented them, ſo that they promiſed always to ſupply them with neceſſaries.</p>

               <p>HAving received this ſeaſonable refreſhment from the <hi>Indians,</hi> they departed for <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> and arrived at the mouth thereof next day, where the ſtream was ſo violent that they took up freſh Water tho' within half a League from the Sea; from three in the afternoon till dark night they rowed up againſt the current which was ſo ſtrong that they got but two
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56659:18"/>
Leagues all that time; In the night they moared their Pinnaces to a Tree, there falling a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shower of Rain, with ſuch ſtrange and terrible thunder and lightning as much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht them, though <hi>Drake</hi> who had before ſeen the like, aſſured them it would not continue above three quarters of an hour; After this ſtorm it became very calm, and ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Gnats or Musketoes fell upon them with their troubleſom ſtings that they could not reſt all that night, nor defend themſelves from them, the beſt remedy they found was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint themſelves with juice of Lemmons. At break of day they proceeded to hale without ceaſing, and about three afternoon they ſpied a Canoo with two <hi>Indians</hi> fiſhing in the River, to whom they ſpake not for fear of diſcovery, nor the other to them judging them <hi>Spaniards;</hi> within an hour after they deſcried ſeveral Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the other ſide the River, the Channel whereof was 25 fathom deep, and ſo broad as one could ſcarce ſee from one ſhore to the other, yet a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who kept theſe Houſes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Pinnaces and thinking them his Countreymen, made a ſmoak for a Signal to them to turn that way, being deſirous to ſpeak with them, they accordingly rowed toward him, and being half way over he waved his hat and long hanging Sleeves to them to come aſhoar, but they drawing nearer he perceived his miſtake, and fled from his Houſes with all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56659:18"/>
ſpeed; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> landing found them to be five in number all full of White Rusk dryed Bacon, Cheeſe of that Countrey ſomewhat like that of <hi>Holland,</hi> but much better taſted, which they ſend as great Preſents into <hi>Spain,</hi> there were alſo Sweatmeats, Conſerves and a great quantity of Sugar provided for the Fleet in their return to <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They loaded their Pinnaces with this ſtore of Proviſions, and by twilight departed, having notice by an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman in thoſe Houſes that the Frigots (uſually thirty or more, which tranſport goods from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> and thence to thoſe Houſes, and ſo in great Canoo's up to <hi>Nova Reyno</hi> with great eaſe the River running many hundred Leagues within the Land and bring back in return the Gold, Silver, Victuals and other Commodities that Kingdom abundantly yeilds) were not yet come from <hi>Carthagena,</hi> ſince the firſt Alarm of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being in the Countrey; <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. they went aboard their Pinnaces from theſe Store-houſes, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having brought ſome <hi>Indians</hi> from a great Town two Miles off called <hi>Villa del Rey</hi> had placed them in the buſhes by the water ſide to annoy them with their Arrows, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rowed down the ſtream to the mouth of the River without damage, where having unloaded all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and cleanſed their Pinnaces according to their Captains Cuſtom, they took all in again
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56659:19"/>
and ſailed Weſt-ward. In their return they diſcovered a Ship, a Bark, and a Frigot, wherein they imagined to have found ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, but when purſued and taken met with nothing of value being bound for Sugar and Hides, ſo that diſmiſſing her they proceeded. <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. between <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Tolou</hi> they took ſix Frigots loaden with live Hogs, Hens and Maiz, which we call <hi>Guiny</hi> wheat, of whom they got what Intelligence they could of the preparations againſt them, and their opinion of them, and then diſcharged four of them and all the men, retaining only two Ships well ſtored with good proviſions.</p>
               <p>Three days after they arrived at <hi>Port Plenty</hi> (where their Captain choſe at firſt to leave his Ship) ſo called by the Company, becauſe they uſually brought thither all the Stores which they took going that way for victualling <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and from the Fleets going out and coming from <hi>Spain</hi> which procured them ſuch abundance of all neceſſarys, that had they been three thouſand Perſons their Pinnaces would have ſufficiently provided them with Wine, Meal, Rusk, Caſſavy bread made of a root called <hi>Yucca</hi> whoſe juice is poyſon but the ſubſtance good and wholeſom, dryed Beef, dryed Fiſh, live Sheep, Hogs and Hens in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, with vaſt ſtore of dainty Fiſh eaſily taken every day. So that they were forced to build four ſeveral Store-houſes ten or twenty Leagues
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56659:19"/>
aſunder both in Iſlands, and on the Main Land, that ſo if the Enemy ſhould ſurprize one they might have another to furniſh them till they had finiſhed their deſired Voyage, in building which the <hi>Negro's</hi> were very skilful and ſpeedy. With this Store they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived themſelves and the <hi>Symerons</hi> while they joined with them, but likewiſe two <hi>French</hi> Ships in much diſtreſs. In <hi>Drakes</hi> abſence Captain <hi>John Drake</hi> his Brother who was left here with one Pinnace ſailed into the Ocean, and rowing not far from the ſhoar (by direction of <hi>Diego</hi> the <hi>Moore</hi> who freely came to them at <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>) he ſpied certain <hi>Symerons</hi> with whom he treated ſo effectually, that at length leaving two <hi>Engliſh</hi> with their Leader, they brought two of theirs aboard the Pinnace, concluding to meet again next day at a River about mid-way between the <hi>Cabezas</hi> and their Ships which they named the River <hi>Diego.</hi> Theſe two <hi>Symerons</hi> being very intelligent men choſen out by their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der declared with much reſpect to Captain <hi>Drake</hi> upon their arrival hither; <hi>That their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were very joyful at his coming knowing him an Enemy to the</hi> Spaniards <hi>not only by his late attempt at</hi> Nombre de Dios, <hi>but in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Voyages, and they were therefore ready to aſſiſt him in all his deſigns againſt his and their inveterate adverſarys, to which end their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Company did now attend at the mouth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56659:20"/>
of</hi> Rio Diego, <hi>expecting what anſwer ſhould be return'd them, that they would willingly have marched by land even to this very place, had not the way been very long and troubleſom with many ſteep Mountains, deep Rivers, and thick Woods and Buſhes, they therefore deſired</hi> Drake <hi>to take ſome ſpeedy and convenient Order on this behalf.</hi> Who comparing the diſcourſe of theſe Perſons with his former Intelligence both from the <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> together with his Brothers information of their great kindneſs to him when lately among them, he with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the reſt, reſolved to go with his brother and the two <hi>Symerons</hi> that Evening to the ſaid River, ordering the reſt of the fleet to follow next morning, his Brother having found out a place thereabout of much ſafety and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it being a very good and plentiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for above ſixty Leagues, and not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by one <hi>Spaniard</hi> or any on their behalf, and lying among a great many excellent Iſlands full of Trees, where though there be Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, yet they are ſo full of Rocks and Shoals as makes it very dangerous to enter by night, whereas a Ship may there lye hid among the Trees.</p>
               <p>Next day <hi>Sept.</hi> 14. arriving at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted River they found ſome of the <hi>Symerons</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe, the reſt of them being a mile upward in a Wood by the Rivers ſide; After they had given them Entertainment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56659:20"/>
and were ſatisfied of their fidelity, they took two more into their Pinnaces, leaving two <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> with them to go by Land to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther River called <hi>Rio Guana</hi> to meet another Company of <hi>Symerons</hi> then in the Mountains; They went that day from <hi>Rio Diego</hi> in their Pinnaces toward their Ship, which they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred did not follow them according to Order. Two days after <hi>Sept.</hi> 16. they found her in the place where they left her, but very much damaged and indangered by a Tempeſt in their abſence, which having refitted they ſent one Pinnace to diſcover the Channel at the bottom of the Bay to bring their Ship nearer the Land; <hi>Sept.</hi> 19. they followed and with much warineſs ſail'd ſafe into the beſt Channel; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five Leagues from <hi>Cativaas</hi> between the Iſland &amp; the Main, they moared their Ship, the Iſland being near the Continent flat and full of Trees and Buſhes. <hi>Sept.</hi> 22. the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> men and the Troop of <hi>Symerons</hi> with twelve others, they met in the Mountains, came in ſight of the Ship, on which they were brought aboard to their great joy, hoping now to be quit with their old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Enemies, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> expecting better ſucceſs by their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>At their firſt meeting when <hi>Drake</hi> moved them to inform him how he might be furniſht with Gold and Silver, they plainly anſwered; <hi>That if they had known he had deſired that they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56659:21"/>
could have given him enough, but at preſent were uncapable becauſe the Rivers wherein they had ſunk a great quantity which they had taken from the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>rather to vex their Foes than for any love they had for it, were now ſo high that they could not get it out of ſuch depths for them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they take any more from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies becauſe the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in theſe Rainy Months are not uſed to carry their Treaſure by Land.</hi> This unexpected anſwer did not diſcontent <hi>Drake,</hi> but rather confirmed their faithfulneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captain to wear out the five months they deſigned to ſpend in thoſe Seas, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his great Guns and Ammunition aſhoar ſending his Pinnaces to the Main Land to fetch over great Trees to make a Fort upon the Iſland to plant his Ordnance thereon, and for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them againſt any attempt of the Enemy. The <hi>Symerons</hi> cut down Palmeto Boughs and Branches, and with ſtrange celerity raiſed up two Houſes large enough for all the Company. The Fort was made Triangular with Timber and Earth, and thirteen foot high.</p>
               <p>Having continued here fourteen days <hi>Octob.</hi> 7. the Captain reſolved to go with three Pinnaces to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> leaving his Brother <hi>John Drake</hi> to govern thoſe who remained with the <hi>Symerons</hi> to finiſh the Fort, and to fetch boards and planks from the prize he left at <hi>Cativaas</hi> where ſhe was drove aſhoar and broken in their abſence, but might now be of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56659:21"/>
uſe to this purpoſe. That night Captain <hi>Drake</hi> came to an Iſland he called the <hi>Spurkite</hi> Iſland, becauſe they found ſtore of Birds like Kites, but very delicate meat; Next day <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. they recovered a large Iſland where they got great quantity of Fiſh, eſpecially of a great Shell Fiſh two foot long, which they called <hi>Whelks.</hi> Next morning being clear of theſe Iſlands and Shoals, they haled off to Sea, and four days after <hi>Octob.</hi> 14. chaſed two Frigots aſhoar near the Iſland of St. <hi>Bernards,</hi> from whence they proceeded to <hi>Tolou</hi> and landed <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. near the Town in a Garden, where certain <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> gave them Bows and Arrows, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with the dainty Fruits and Roots therein, for which they went not unrewarded, hoping to learn intelligence of the Country and Fleets from them. They quickly went hence to <hi>Careſha</hi> the Iſland of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and with a full gale ſailed towards the City, caſting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor between the Iſland and the Continent right againſt the goodly Garden Iſland, in which the Captain would not ſuffer them to Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent Souldiers thither when they heard any Men of War were on the Coaſt, which happened according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for three hours after paſſing by the Point of the Iſland they had a Volley of an hundred ſhot from them, yet not one of their men hurt, that Evening they went to Sea, and next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two Leagues off, they took a Bark, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56659:22"/>
found that her Captain his Wife and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Paſſengers had forſaken her, and were gone aſhoar in their Gundeloe, ſo that they boarded her without reſiſtance, though very well provided with Swords, Targets, ſmall Shot and Iron Guns; She was about fifty Tun, with ten Marriners, five or ſix <hi>Negro's,</hi> great ſtore of Sope and Sweet-meats bound from St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> the Captain having left behind him a Silk Ancient with his Arms at his haſty departing.</p>
               <p>Next day <hi>Octob.</hi> 18. they ſet all the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners aſhoar to ſeek their Maſters, retaining only a young <hi>Negro</hi> three or four years old, and the Bark, wherein they bore into the mouth of <hi>Carthagena</hi> Harbor, and there anchored; That afternoon divers Horſe came down to the Wood-ſide in company with the forementioned <hi>Scrivano,</hi> toward their Bark with a Flag of Truce, deſiring ſecurity for his coming and going, which being granted he came aboard and gave the Captain many thanks for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated favours, promiſing to bring him before morning as much proviſions as he deſired, what danger or puniſhment ſoever he incurred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Yet all this was only a trick of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to gain time and ſtrength enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them, ſo that ſeeing no appearance of this fair pretender by Sun-riſing, they put to Sea to the Weſt, and lay at Hull the reſt of that day and night. <hi>Oct.</hi> 20. Afternoon two Frigots
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56659:22"/>
bound for Sir <hi>Domingo</hi> came out of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> one of fifty and the other of twelve Tun, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en only with ballaſt, which they took a League from the Town and came to an Anchor with them with in Shot of the Eaſt-Bulwark, ſhe had about thirteen common Marriners, who deſiring to be ſet aſhoar, the Captain gave them the great Frigots <hi>Gondeloe,</hi> and diſmiſt them.</p>
               <p>Next morning when they came down to the Weſt Point with a Flag of Truce the Captain rowed aſhoar in his Pinnace, whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fled, and hid themſelves in the Woods pretending fear of the Great Guns, but thereby intending to draw them aſhoar in the purſuit, whereupon <hi>Drake</hi> leapt out on the Sand to defy them and ſhew that he durſt land, though he ſtayed not long to let them know that though he were not able to conquer them, yet he perfectly underſtood their deſigns; The Captain coming again aboard they returned back upon the Sand ſending a Youth as from the Governor to know what they deſigned by ſtaying ſo long on thoſe Coaſts. <hi>Drake</hi> reply'd; <hi>He meant to traffick with them, having Tin, Pewter, Cloth and other Merchandize which he knew they had occaſion for;</hi> The Youth ſwum back again with this anſwer, and inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with another Meſſage, <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>had forbidden traffick with any Forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners except for Powder and Shot of which if he had any quantity they would buy it;</hi> He replyed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56659:23"/>
                  <hi>That he was come from his Countrey to exchange his Goods for Gold and Silver, and was unwilling to return without his errand, and that he believed they would have little reſt if they did not fairly traffick with him;</hi> He gave the Meſſenger a fine Shirt for a reward and ſo diſcharged him, who rowling his Shirt about his head, ſwum quickly back again. They heard no anſwer all that day, but kept ſtrict watch; Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about break of day they ſaw two Sails mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward them, but coming nigh they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the many heads peering above board that they were mann'd and ſet forth from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena</hi> to fight with them, or at leaſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Frigots they had taken, but were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in both, for leaving <hi>John Oxnam</hi> with one Pinnace, to entertain thoſe Men of War, <hi>Drake</hi> haſtned in the other to ſecure the Ships left at Anchor, and cauſed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who mean time had gotten aboard in a ſmall Canoo to have towed the Frigots within danger of the Shot) to make all poſſible haſt away, ſome being forc't to ſwim a land, leaving their Swords, Targets, Flasks, and Calivers behind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he could not man them, he ſunk one, and burnt the other to ſhew them their ſecret practices were diſcovered.</p>
               <p>This done <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. he returned to <hi>John Oxnam</hi> who mean while lay by the Men of War without offering to fight; When the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came up the wind blew ſo hard that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56659:23"/>
Pinnaces were forced to give way, which cauſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to rejoice in hope they fled, but when they came into Harbor and had ſmooth water, the Pinnaces ingaged the Enemy with advantage, ſo that after a few Shot exchanged and a ſtorm ariſing, they fear'd to preſs nearer, and the ſtorm continuing whereby they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſucceſs they retired into the Town, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were obliged by the Foul Weather to continue there four days, feeling much cold from the rains and Weſterly winds, and very little Shelter in their Pinnaces. The fift day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Octob.</hi> 27. a Frigot coming from Sea, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> make to her, ran aſhoar, taking off her Rudder &amp; Sails to prevent being carried away, but coming up to her, they perceived near an hundred Horſe and Foot well Armed coming to the Point, with whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed ſome Shot, one of which paſſed ſo near a principal Commander among them that they concluded to retreat into the Woods, where they might reſcue the Frigot, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently annoy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go to Sea again intending to take down their Maſts, and ride on the Rocks called <hi>Las Serenas</hi> two Leagues off at Sea, as they uſually did, and were hardly diſtinguiſhed from the Rocks, but the Waves were ſo high that they were forced to continue ſix days in the Harbor to the great diſturbance of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> who contrived another device againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56659:24"/>For <hi>Nov.</hi> 2. They ſent forth a great Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, a Gondeloe, and a Great Canoo, with ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Musketeers, and many <hi>Indians</hi> with poyſoned Arrows, as if to begin a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and then to fly, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rowing toward them and firing, they inſtantly landed and retired into the Woods, where an ambuſh of ſixty Muskets lay, beſide two Pinnaces and a Frigot very well manned. They boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them, aſſiſted by thoſe out of the Wood who again got aboard the Gondeloe and Canoo, and ſeeing the Engliſh coming up, aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſucceſs from the Ambuſcade, but <hi>Drake</hi> foreſeeing the danger of the attempt, kept out of reach of their Shot from land, and the Enemy freely ſpent their Powder on them two or three hours, wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had only one man wounded, but ſaw the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pinnaces ſhot through in ſeveral places, and the powder of one took fire, whereupon <hi>Drake</hi> deſigned to come up and board them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which they rowed ſpeedily to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the Wood, being diſappointed of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Frigot which the wind would not ſuffer either to help them or offend their Enemies; Diſpairing therefore of any prize in theſe Parts, and Victuals growing ſcarce, <hi>Drake</hi> returned again <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. to <hi>Rio de Grand,</hi> and on the Coaſt in their paſſage found great ſtore of Victuals; After two days, arriving at the Villages of ſtore where they were before ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56659:24"/>
with abundance of Hens, Sheep, Calves, Hogs and the like, they now found nothing left, nor any people to be ſeen, flying by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> command into the Mountains, and driving away all their Cattle that they might have no relief from them; Troubled hereat and much of their Victuals being ſpoyled at Sea, they were revived by the ſight of a Frigot from whom they expected relief, but upon boarding perceived ſhe had neither Meat nor Money, being bound for <hi>Rio Grand</hi> to take in proviſion upon Bills.</p>
               <p>This adding to their grief they lived upon a certain allowance ſeven or eight days and Sailed toward <hi>Sancta Martha</hi> in hope of Shipping in the Road, or Fiſhes on the Rocks, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving near the Town the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing them Men of War, placed forty Musketeers ſecretly among the Clifts, who annoyed them ſo unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengedly that they were forct to quit that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, though indangered by a ſtorm without, and want within, and go to Sea, and the Enemy to give them a farewell made an unlucky Shot from a Culverin between the Pinnaces, while they were conſulting how to proceed; Some adviſed to land in ſome place Eaſt-ward to get Victuals, and rather venture on the kindneſs of the Countrey people than continue at Sea in ſuch a cold ſtorm and a leaky Pinnace, but <hi>Drake</hi> reſolved to bear up toward <hi>Rio de Hacca</hi> or <hi>Coriazo,</hi> hoping there to meet with plenty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56659:25"/>
without reſiſtance either from the Inhabitants or ſome Prize in the Harbor; The Company in the other Pinnace anſwered, <hi>They would willingly follow him through the World, but they did not think their Pinnace could endure a ſtorm, nor themſelves the want of proviſions ſo long, having only one Gammon of Bacon and thirty pound of Bisket for eighteen men;</hi> The Captain replyed, <hi>They were better provided than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had but one Gammon of Bacon, and forty pound of Bisket for twenty four men, and therefore hoped they would take their Lot with him and freely depend upon Divine Providence which never fails thoſe that truſt therein;</hi> Upon this he hoiſed Sail for <hi>Corizao,</hi> which the reſt perceiving, reſolved to follow their Captain, though with ſorrowful hearts becauſe of the weakneſs of their Pinnace.</p>
               <p>They had not ſailed above three Leagues when a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship about ninety Tun appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which they joyfully expected to be their own, but being haled, ſhe deſpiſed their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and gave them a Gun, the Sea went very high ſo that they could not attempt her, but after a great Shower a Calm enſuing, they purſued and quickly took her, which being laden with Victuals well powdred and dryed, they received as ſent them by the mercy of Heaven. <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. <hi>Edward Hixom</hi> by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains order going, in ſearch of ſome Harbor along the Coaſt, diſcovered a very convenient place
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56659:25"/>

               <p>The ſickneſs which began among them, now appeared by the death of <hi>Charles Club</hi> their Quartermaſter, and a very Skilful Seaman, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned as they judged by the cold the men had got lately in their Pinnaces, yet the reſt of the Company, though ill, recovered their health.

In ſeven days after <hi>Drake</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at St. <hi>Bernards,</hi> but found only twelve <hi>Botajo's</hi> of Wine of the great ſtore they had left there, which eſcaped the ſtrict ſearch of

the Enemy who had been there ſince, by being buried very deep in the ground. <hi>Nov.</hi> 27. they came to their Ship and received the ill tydings of the death of <hi>John Drake</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Brother and <hi>Richard Allen</hi> a young man, both ſlain at one time in attempting to board a Frigot two days after their departure from them; for in going toward their Fort with Planks for the Platform they ſaw a Frigot at Sea, which the Company perſwaded him to fall upon as a good prize; He replyed, <hi>They wanted arms to aſſault them, and knew not how ſtrong they were, and his Boat was now loaden with Planks, to finiſh his Brothers Orders;</hi> This not ſatisfying them, and they ſeeming reſolved, <hi>Well, ſaid he, if you will needs venture you ſhall never ſay I will be hindmoſt, nor report to my Brother that you loſt your Voyage by my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Making then the beſt proviſion poſſible, and heaving their Planks overboard, they armed themſelves with ſuch poor weapons as they had, that is, a broken pointed Sword, an old Carbine, and a ruſty Musket. <hi>John Drake</hi> took the Sword, and made a Shield of his Pillow, <hi>Richard Allen</hi> had the Carbine, ſtanding in the head of the Pinnace, and <hi>Roberts</hi> managed the Musket, and ſo they boarded the Frigot, but found her hung round about with Hides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which ſhe was full of Pikes and ſmall ſhot, which they diſcharged in their faces, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

wounded <hi>John Drake</hi> in the belly, and <hi>Richard Allen</hi> in the head, who yet got off the Pinnace, freed themſelves from the Frigot, and haſtily recovered the Ship, wherein within an hour theſe hopeful young men died with much regret of the Company; Having moared their Ships faſt, Captain <hi>Drake</hi> reſolved not to go to Sea again, but to conceal himſelf till the coming of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, ſupplying himſelf and the <hi>Symerons</hi> out of his Store-houſe, beſides the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relief they got of wild Hogs, Pheaſants and Guanas out of the Woods, whereby they by God's bleſſing continued in health till <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 3. when ſix of their Company fell ſick and died within two or three days, yea they had thirty at a time ſick of a Calenture occaſioned by the ſudden change from cold to heat, or from the ſalt or brackiſh water taken in at the mouth of the River by the ſloth of the Seamen who would not go further up. Among others <hi>Joſeph Drake</hi> another of the Captain's Brothers died in his Arms of that Diſeaſe, who being opened, his Liver was ſwoln, his Heart as if boyled, and his Guts all fair, the Surgeon that diſſected him died four days after, though not of the Calenture, of which he recovered about a month before, but by preſumptuouſly giving himſelf ſuch a ſtrong Purge, that he never ſpoke word after taking it, and his Boy who was ſick only by taſting it, not recovering his health till he came to <hi>England.</hi>

All things thus ordered, and the Captain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the Chief of the <hi>Symerons,,</hi> what Weapons, Proviſions and Apparel were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for this great and long Journey; They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to carry as many Shoes as poſſible becauſe of the many Rivers full of Stones and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel they were to paſs;</p>
               <p>Preparation of all neceſſaries made <hi>Febr.</hi> 3. being <hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> they began their Journey with moſt of their Company having already loſt, twenty eight men, and leaving only a few ſound men with <hi>Hixom</hi> to ſecure the Ship and Priſoners, and tend the ſick; At his departure <hi>Drake</hi> gave <hi>Hixom</hi> ſtrict charge not to credit any Meſſenger who ſhould come in his name with any token unleſs he brought his hand-writing, which he knew neither the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> nor <hi>Symerons</hi> could counterfeit. They were in all 48 whereof 18 were <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the reſt <hi>Symerons,</hi> who beſides their arms, carryed each a great quantity of Victuals, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had nothing to toil them but their Arms in this long Journey, and becauſe they could not carry enough for a full ſupply, they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promiſe, provided ſufficient ſtore with their Arrows by the way; They had each two ſorts of Arrows, one to aſſault the Enemy, and others to kill Victuals, the firſt are very long and headed with Iron, Wood or Fiſh-bones, the other have ſome a head of Iron of a pound and half weight, ſhaped like the head of a Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56659:28"/>
and ſharp as a knife, making ſo deep a Wound into an Ox, Stag or Wild-Boar as is hardly credible; They have others with leſs heads ſome to kill ſmaller Cattel, and others ſtill leſs for Birds, and are ſo well tempered as not to be eaſily Blunted nor broken, their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of theſe Weapons makes them value Iron much above Gold, and whoever has skill to give a true temper to theſe Arrows is highly valued. They marcht every day from ſun-riſing till ten in the forenoon, and then again from twelve to four, always repoſing near ſome River either in Houſes they found ready, or elſe ſuch as were quickly erected by the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who when they came where they deſigned to reſt inſtantly cut down branches of <hi>Palmetto</hi> Trees which ſerved for Poſts and Rafters, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them cloſe with Plaintain and Palmetto leaves they were very well ſecured from the Rain and Sun; They would ſpeedily erect ſix of theſe Houſes and made three Fires in each, one at each end and another in the middle, which they ſo contrived that the ſmoak never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the place was temperately warm. Near theſe Rivers they found divers wholeſom Fruits as <hi>Mammeas, Guyavas, Palmetto's, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Oranges, Lemons:</hi> and divers others, which the <hi>Symerons</hi> perſwaded them to eat with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, except roaſted Plantanes Potato's and the like. If in the way they ſaw any wild Hogs on the Hills or Valleys, the <hi>Symerons</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56659:28"/>
would uſually ſix at a time, deliver their burthens to their Fellows, and immediately purſue, kill, and bring away as much as they could carry and the time would permit. One day they found an Otter, and went to dreſſing it; <hi>Drake</hi> wondring at it, <hi>Pedro</hi> the Chief <hi>Symeron</hi> ſaid, <hi>Are you a man of War and in want and yet doubt whether this be meat which hath bloud in it?</hi> Whereupon the Captain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly chid him that he had not told them of it before.</p>
               <p>The third day of their Travels they brought them to a Town of their own, on the ſide of a Hill near a fine River, encompaſt with a Ditch eight foot broad, and a Mud-wall ten foot high, to prevent a ſudden ſurprize; It had one long broad Street Eaſt and Weſt, and two leſs croſſing it, conſiſting of about ſixty Families, the Houſes and Streets being very clean and ſweet, and the People lived very civilly and cleanly; When the <hi>Symerons</hi> came hither, they waſhed themſelves in the River, and changed their Apparel, which was very fine and exactly made, as were likewiſe their Womens Garments, much like the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but not ſo coſtly; This Town is 35 Leagues from <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios</hi> and 45 from <hi>Parnama,</hi> plentifully ſtored with Cattle, Fowl, Maiz, and divers Fruits. As to their Religion, they have no Prieſts, only they held the Croſs in much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, but by <hi>Drakes</hi> perſwaſion they left it,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56659:29"/>
and learnt the Lords Prayer, ſeeming willing to be inſtructed in the Worſhip of God; They keep a conſtant Guard in four parts three mile off the Town to prevent the miſchiefs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who are oft conducted againſt them by the <hi>Symerons</hi> themſelves, whereby they ſometimes prevailed againſt them when they lived careleſly, but ſince this having uſually no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their coming, they many times ſurprize the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and kill them in the Woods like Beaſts.</p>
               <p>They ſtayed with the <hi>Symerons</hi> that night <hi>Febr.</hi> 7. and the next day till noon, during which they related many ſtrange accidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; That a gallant Gentleman entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governors of the Countrey undertook the laſt year with an 150 Souldiers to deſtroy Man, Woman and Child in this Town, being conducted by one of their own who had been taken Priſoner, and bribed with gifts; He accordingly ſurprized them half an hour before day, whereby moſt of the men eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped in the dark, but many Women and Children were murdered or taken; But at Sun-riſing, this Gallant their Leader being ſlain in purſuing another mans Wife, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> reſumed their Courage, and getting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, fell ſo furiouſly on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that flying into the Woods without a Guide moſt of them periſht by Famine, and not above thirty
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56659:29"/>
eſcaped to carry the news to thoſe that ſent them. Their King dwelt in a City 16 Leagues South-Eaſt of <hi>Panama,</hi> and was able to raiſe 17 hundred fighting men; They were very earneſt with Captain <hi>Drake</hi> to ſtay two or three days, ingaging to double his number of men by that time if he thought good; But he thanking them for their kind offer, reſolved to proſecute his Voyage, declaring, <hi>He would uſe no more ſtrength if he might have twenty times as much;</hi> Which they judging to proceed not only from kindneſs but courage, they willingly marched away that afternoon, four of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> who beſt knew the ways going about a mile before and breaking down boughs for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to thoſe that followed, all being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned great ſilence; after them, twelve went before as a Van-guard, and twelve more in the Reer, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the two <hi>Symeron</hi> Captains marching in the midſt; All the way through the Woods was cool and pleaſant with the thick and high Trees, ſo that it was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable travelling in that hot Countrey as in <hi>England</hi> in the heat of Summer. They were much incouraged by hearing there was a great Tree about the midway where they might at once diſcern the North-Sea from whence they came, and the South-Sea whither they were going.</p>
               <p>The fourth day after <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. they came to the top of this deſired Hill, which was very
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56659:30"/>
high, and lay Eaſt and Weſt like a ridge between the two Seas: It was about Ten a Clock in the morning when one of the Chief <hi>Symerons</hi> taking <hi>Drake</hi> by the hand, deſired him to walk up this famous high Tree wherein they had cut divers ſteps to aſcend almoſt to the top, where they had made a convenient Arbour for twelve men conveniently to ſit, and from whence without difficulty they might plainly diſcern both the North and South <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, many of the adjoyning Trees being cut down to clear the proſpect, and divers ſtrong Houſes built thereabout by the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who uſually paſs that way, and inhabit thoſe vaſt Countreys; <hi>Drake</hi> having aſcended the Tree, and the weather being fair, taking a full view of that Sea of which he had heard ſuch golden reports, he beſought God to give him life and leave once to ſail an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship in thoſe Seas, <hi>John Oxnam</hi> and the reſt of his Company aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him they would aſſiſt him therein to the utmoſt; All ſatisfied with this pleaſing ſight they deſcended, and being refreſht, marcht two days further into the Woods, and then came into a Champain Countrey, where the Graſs grows ſo very high, that their Cattel (of which they have abundance) cannot reach it, ſo that the Inhabitants are forced to burn it thrice a year five or ſix Miles together, and yet after it is burnt, within three days it again ſprings like green Corn; ſuch is the fruitfulneſs
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56659:30"/>
of the ſoil by the equality of the days and nights, and the rich dews falling every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In their three laſt days march over the Hills they ſaw <hi>Panama</hi> five or ſix times a day and the Ships riding in the road, but being come within a days Journey, the <hi>Symerons</hi> declaring that the Ladies of <hi>Panama</hi> uſed to imploy Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Fowlers to take the curious Fowls in that Countrey, by whom they might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>Drake</hi> cauſed all his Company to travel out of the ordinary road, with great ſilence to the Grove agreed on four days before within a League of <hi>Panama,</hi> where they might lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, near the high-way to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> From hence they ſent a <hi>Symeron</hi> who formerly was a Servant in <hi>Panama</hi> in ſuch apparel as their <hi>Negro's</hi> uſe in War, into the Town, to learn the certain night and hour when the Kings Treaſure was laden from the Treaſure-houſe to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> for they always travel by night from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> becauſe of the heat of the Champain Countrey, but from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> they go always with their Treaſure by day through the cool freſh Woods, unleſs the <hi>Symerons</hi> happily make them ſweat for fear, as oft happens, and therefore their Recoes are guarded with Souldiers; The laſt day <hi>Drake</hi> took a full View of that fair City, and the large ſtreet therein, and by three a Clock
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56659:31"/>
came ſecretly into the Grove along a River then almoſt dried up, from whence he diſpatcht a Spy into the City in the Evening, who quickly returned with intelligence from his Companions there, <hi>That the Treaſurer of</hi> Lima <hi>intending to go into</hi> Spain <hi>in a good Ship of</hi> 350 <hi>Tun called the</hi> Adviſo, <hi>deſigned that night to travel with his Daughter and Family to</hi> Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios <hi>accompanied with fourteen Mules, eight of them laden with Gold, and one with Jewels, and that there were two other Reco's each of fifty Mules laden with Victuals, and ſome ſmall quantity of Silver to go this night alſo;</hi> There are twenty-eight of theſe Recoes (or Company of Mules and People travelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the greateſt conſiſting of 70, the leſs of 50 Mules unleſs 10, 20, or 30 more are hired by particular Perſons upon their own occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Upon this notice they inſtantly marcht with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Leagues of <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> when two <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> ſent before, diſcovering a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the Scent of his Match, aſleep, they ſtopt his mouth, put out his Match, and bound him ſo ſtrictly as had almoſt ſtrangled him before they brought him to the Captain, who being examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all that the Spy had reported, and that he was a Souldier entertained with others by the Treaſurer for guarding the Treaſure from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> The Souldier underſtanding <hi>Drake</hi> was their Capt. took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56659:31"/>
to requeſt him, That he would command the <hi>Symerons</hi> who extreamly hated the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> eſpecially the Souldiers, not to do him any miſchief, whom he knew they durſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, and that ſince he was a Souldier, and was aſſured that the Captain would gain that night more Gold, Jewels and Pearls than they all could carry away (if not they ſhould deal with him as they would) he would pleaſe if it ſo happened to beſtow as much on him as might ſuffice for himſelf and his Miſtriſs to live upon, as he had heard he had done to divers before, for which he ſhould proclaim his bounty with as great praiſes as others who had received the like favours had done. Being come to the place appointed <hi>Drake</hi> with half his men lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 paces off the high-way in the long graſs, and <hi>John Oxnam</hi> with the Capt. of the <hi>Symerons</hi> and the other half, were placed on the other ſide the way, but ſo far behind that the firſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might take the foremoſt Mules by the head, and the other the hindmoſt, they being tyed together, and driven one after another, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that if they ſhould uſe their arms that night they might avoid hurting each other in the dark; Having lain in ambuſh about an hour they heard the Recoes paſſing to and fro in the road from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> they having a great trade when the Fleets are there, the ſound of their great Bells wherein they delight being heard a long way in a dark night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56659:32"/>
                  <hi>Drake</hi> had ſtrictly commanded that none of his men ſhould ſtir or appear, but let all that came from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> paſs quietly with their Recoes, as knowing they carried nothing but common Merchandiſe, yet one <hi>Robert Pike</hi> having drunk too much <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> without Water forgetting himſelf, perſwaded a <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> to go into the road, and ſeize on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Mules, and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe-man riding by with his Page running on his ſide, <hi>Pike</hi> unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly ſtarted up to ſee who he was, though the <hi>Symeron</hi> diſcreetly endeavoured to pull him down, and lay upon him to prevent further diſcovery, yet by this the Gentleman taking notice of one all in white, they having put their Shirts over all their Cloths to prevent miſtakes in the night, he put Spurs to his Horſe both to ſecure himſelf, and give notice to others of the danger; <hi>Drake</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the hardneſs of the ground and ſtilneſs of the night that the Gentleman changed his Trot into a Gallop, doubted of the truth, yet had not leiſure to examine by whoſe fault they were diſcovered, but conſidering it might be from the danger of the place, alwaies ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by Travellers, he lay ſtill, expecting the Treaſurer, who was now within half a League, and had come forward had he not been met with by this Horſe-man (as they after underſtood by the Recoes) who telling him what he had ſeen and alſo what he had oft
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56659:32"/>
heard of Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> whom he ſuſpected to be concerned in this buſineſs, who having been diſappointed of getting any Treaſure at <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and other places, he believed was one way or other come by land through the covert of the Woods to this place in hope of better fortune, ſo that he perſwaded him to turn his own Mules richly laden out of the way and let the others paſs on, which being only loaden with Victuals, the loſs would be leſs, yet would diſcover who they were as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Thus by the folly and careleſneſs of one man, and the carefulneſs of this Traveller they were diſappointed of a very rich Booty. The Mules coming up were inſtantly ſtopt and ſeiz'd on, the Driver a very ſenſible fellow telling <hi>Drake</hi> how they were diſcovered, and adviſing them to ſhift for themſelves unleſs they were able to oppoſe the whole power of the City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which before day would certainly come out againſt them. It much diſpleaſed them to be diſappointed of their Golden Hopes, and that they could not find above two Horſe-load of Silver, but it grieved the Captain much more that he was diſcovered, and that by one of his own men, but ſince it was paſt remedy and time was precious, <hi>Pedro</hi> Captain of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> adviſed either to return back privately about four Leagues into the Wood, or elſe to march forward in the high-way to <hi>Venta Cruz</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56659:33"/>
two Leagues off, and fight their way through their Enemies; <hi>Drake</hi> concluded on the laſt courſe, conſidering the long weary marches they had taken, chuſing rather to encounter his adverſarys while they had ſtrength than to be fallen upon by them when wearied, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having now ſome Mules to eaſe them in carrying their baggage. Commanding them all to refreſh themſelves with the abundant provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they had got, he declared to them all his reſolution and the reaſon of it, particularly asking <hi>Pedro</hi> whether he would give him his hand not to forſake him, being aſſured the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> would follow their Captain, who glad of his deſign, gave <hi>Drake</hi> his hand, vowing that in proſecuting it he would rather dye at his foot than to leave him his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Having refreſht themſelves they travelled by the help of the Mules till within a Mile of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> when diſcharging them, they charged the Mule-keepers not to follow them upon pain of Death; The way is cut through the Woods about twelve foot broad, for two Mules to paſs, and the Soil ſo fruitful that with often cutting the Woods grow as thick as the thickeſt Hedges in <hi>England.</hi> In the midſt of the Wood a Company of Souldiers who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lay in the Town to defend it againſt the <hi>Symerons</hi> came forth to ſtop them, or if not to retreat to their ſtrength and expect their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Convent of Friers with their Leader

a place of better ſtrength, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> purſued them, and the <hi>Symerons</hi> having for fear of the Shot ſtept aſide, when they obſerv'd them marching forward, came all in again with their Arrows ready in their Bows dancing and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Yo' Peho', Yo' Peho,</hi> after the manner of their own Countrey Wars till they overtook ſome of the Enemy who had taken their ſtand as before in a Wood at the Towns-end; The <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> now throughly incouraged, ſeeing this broke through the thickeſt of them, forcing them to fly Friers and all, though ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were wounded and one <hi>Symeron</hi> run through with a Pike, who yet had ſo much courage as to kill him who gave that deadly wound.</p>
               <p>They followed the chaſe ſo cloſe that they entred the Town of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> conſiſting in about fifty Houſes, ſome very fair, with a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and other Officers, and many large ſtrong Store-houſes for ſecuring the goods brought thither from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> by the River <hi>Chagro</hi> to be tranſported by Mules to <hi>Panama.</hi> In the Houſes they found three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies lately delivered there of Children though they dwelt at <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> they having long obſerved, that no <hi>Spaniard</hi> or white Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could be ſafely delivered there, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren generally dying within two or three days, but if born and brought up in <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> till about ſix year old, and then brought to <hi>Nombre

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> having ſet neceſſary Guards as well on the Bridge they went over as at the Towns end where they entred, and was the only paſſage by land into it, they had liberty to ſtay there quietly an hour and half, not only refreſhing themſelves but getting good plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which <hi>Drake</hi> gave between his men and the <hi>Symerons</hi> as being cumberſom, and not what he came for.

               <p>HAving ended their buſineſs in <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> by day-break they marched over the Bridge in the ſame order as before, being as ſafe in their own opinions as if ſecured by a Wall or Fort, no <hi>Spaniard</hi> daring to follow them, and the <hi>Symerons</hi> being now much more valiant than before; But <hi>Drake</hi> conſidering he had been almoſt a fortnight from his Ship, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board which he left many ſick, made all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble haſt back, without viſiting the other <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi> Towns, though earneſtly intreated by them, and incouraging his men by aſſuring them that he did not doubt but they would yet be fully recompenced for all their pains before he left that Coaſt; Theſe diſcourſes ſeem'd to ſhorten the way, and their haſt cauſed them to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56659:35"/>
leave the Towns, &amp; march many days with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtomacks, to the great regret of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who if the Captain would have ſtayed at any place could quickly have kill'd Victuals enough. In their abſence the other <hi>Symerons</hi> had built a little Town three Leagues off the Port where their Ship lay, wherein <hi>Drake</hi> by their earneſt intreaty ſtaid ſome time, becauſe they ſaid, it was built for his ſake and the rather that they might be ſupplied, with Shoes by the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who were herein very uſeful to them; All the men complaining of their feet, and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though ſometime without cauſe joining in their complaint to make it ſeem eaſier to them. Theſe <hi>Symerons</hi> were extream ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them all the time they were with him, and particularly in this Journey, being Guides to direct them, Intelligencers, Purveyors of Victuals, Carpenters to build Houſes, and Porters to carry all neceſſaries with their ſtrong bodies, and when any fainted or were ſick, two <hi>Symerons</hi> would carry him with eaſe two miles together, and at other times they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs valiant than judicious.</p>
               <p>From this Town the Captain ſent a <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Feb.</hi> 22. to the Maſter of the Ship with a Token and Orders, who for three weeks paſt had kept watch upon the Enemy, and ſhifted in the Woods for freſh Victual to relieve and recover his men aboard; This Meſſenger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Shoar and calling to the Ship, was

ſoon fetcht aboard, all hoping for good news from their Captain, but when he ſhewed the Tooth-pick of Gold which he ſaid <hi>Drake</hi> had ſent as a Token to <hi>Edward Hixom</hi> with charge to meet him at ſuch a River, though he knew it to be the Captains Tooth-pick, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his Caveat at parting, though he ſeemed not to diſtruſt the <hi>Symeron,</hi> he ſtood amazed much doubting leſt ſome misfortune had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len him; Which the <hi>Symeron</hi> perceiving told him, <hi>It was night when he came away, ſo that he could not ſend a Letter, but yet with the point of a Knife he writ ſomething on the Tooth-pick, which he ſaid was ſufficient to give credit to him;</hi> The Maſter looking on it ſaw writ, <hi>By me Francis Drake,</hi> wherewith being ſatisfied, he prepared for the River <hi>Tortugos</hi> according to the <hi>Symerons</hi> direction. About three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon <hi>Drake</hi> and his men coming down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the River within half an hour the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace arrived to receive them, and great joy was expreſt among them all for their happy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again; <hi>Drake</hi> and his Company appeared to the reſt (who had lived at reſt and in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſtrangely changed both in Countenance and Body, occaſioned by their faſting and long Travel, but more for inward grief that they returned without the hoped-for Gold and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; The reſt who by reaſon of weakneſs were left behind at the <hi>Indian</hi> Town, were next day by another River at the bottom of the Bay all brought aboard again.</p>

two for his Women, each Pezo being eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings three pence, amounting in the whole to above</hi> 200 <hi>pound Sterling a day, ſo that he had heaped together a mighty Maſs of Treaſure which he kept in ſeveral great Cheſts two Foot deep, three broad and four long, being notwithſtanding all his Wealth miſerably covetous, and never going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without a Guard of five or ſix men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from danger which he extreamly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from all Creatures, and if the Captain would undertake the getting this mighty booty,</hi> the <hi>Symerons</hi> ingag'd to conduct them ſafe through the Woods without entring any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Havens, but might come on their backs unexpectedly, and though his houſe being of Stone could not be eaſily burnt, yet if the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would undertake it, they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, overthrow, or break it open, and make the acceſs to this vaſt Treaſure eaſie.</p>

               <p>Captain <hi>Drake</hi> conſidering ſeriouſly of this

matter, thought once of returning to his Ship for ſome of <hi>Pezoro</hi>'s former Servants to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the point, but the <hi>Genoa</hi> Pilot preſſing him to loſe no time, he diſmiſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got lightning it only of the Silver to haſten their ſpeed; and then by the advice of this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot whom he took aboard, he laboured with Sails and Oars to attain the Harbor of <hi>Nicara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua</hi> in the night, ſince they might now gain this Golden Prize, and attempt <hi>Pezoro's</hi> Houſe afterward; Coming to the mouth of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, they heard two great Guns, and two more further within the Bay anſwering them, which cauſed the Pilot to ſuſpect they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, affirming, <hi>This Order was taken ſince his being there, becauſe the Governor of</hi> Panama, <hi>had ſent notice to all places of</hi> Drakes <hi>being on the Coaſt, which cauſed ſuch terror among them that they hardly ſlept quietly in their Beds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probably kept up this Watch at the charge and for the ſecurity of</hi> Pezoro <hi>the rich Miſer;</hi> Being thus defeated of their expectation they returned to their Ship, when <hi>Oxnam</hi> being likewiſe come back, had only taken one Frigot with ten men whom they ſet aſhoar, great ſtore of Maiz, twenty eight fat Hogs and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Hens, of which diſcharging her, the Captain finding the Veſſel new, ſtrong and of a good mould, fitted her up with great Guns and Proviſions for a Man of War, having notice by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> laſt taken that there were two
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56659:38"/>
little Gallies built at <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to convey the <hi>Chagro</hi> Fleet to and fro, but were not yet lanched, which Fleet he reſolved now to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to incourage his men feaſted them nobly on <hi>Eaſter-day March,</hi> 20. upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Next day the new Frigot and the <hi>Bear</hi> ſailed toward the <hi>Cativaas,</hi> and landed about Noon, when obſerving a Sail making toward the Iſland they plied them, and perceiving by their confidence they were no <hi>Spaniards</hi> but <hi>Engliſh</hi> of whom they heard long before, being in much diſtreſs they made up to them, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Their Captain was named</hi> Tetu <hi>a</hi> French <hi>man of</hi> Newhaven <hi>and a Man of War deſirous of relief, humbly beſeeching</hi> Drake <hi>to give them ſome Water, having nothing aboard but Wine and Cyder, which made his men ſick, and that he had been ſeeking the</hi> Engliſh <hi>five weeks ſince he heard they were on the Coaſt;</hi> The Captain ſent one aboard with preſent relief, promiſing them Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Victuals at the next Port. Coming to Anchor <hi>Tetu</hi> ſent Captain <hi>Drake</hi> a Caſe of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, and a fine gilt Scimeter formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King of <hi>France</hi> whom <hi>Montgomery</hi> hurt in the Eye, and given him by Mounſieur <hi>Scroff, Drake</hi> requited him with a Chain of Gold and a Tablet which he wore. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain brought the news of the great diſturbances at <hi>Paris</hi> at the Marriage of the King of <hi>Navar</hi> laſt St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day, with the death of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56659:39"/>
the Admiral of <hi>France</hi> and many others, ſo that they thought thoſe <hi>Frenchmen</hi> moſt happy that were fartheſt from <hi>France,</hi> which was now in a very deplorable condition. He told them what reports there were of <hi>Drakes</hi> great Riches, and deſired to know how he might likewiſe make a good Voyage.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſome jealouſy of him, yet upon conſultation they reſolved to take him and twenty of his men to ſerve with their Capt. half ſhares, being thereby ſecured againſt their numbers, and not damaged by that part of the gain; <hi>Tetu</hi> had 70 men and they but 31, his Ship was 80 and there's but 20 Tun, and the Pinnace ten. And therefore they hoped for aſſiſtance from him in proſecuting their Voyage, and having agreed with him to meet at <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> they ſent for two <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> aboard to aſſure the <hi>French</hi> of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Having in five or ſix days refreſht themſelves and the <hi>French,</hi> who were very thankful for this ſeaſonable relief, leaving, their two Ships in ſafe Harbor, they manned their Frigot and two Pinnaces (having ſunk the <hi>Lyon</hi> after their return from <hi>Panama</hi> for want of men) with twenty <hi>French</hi> and 15 <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Symerons,</hi> wherewith they ſailed toward <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> where the water being ſhallow they left their Frigot at the <hi>Cabezas</hi> in charge with <hi>Robert Dable</hi> charging him to attempt nothing till their return with their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56659:39"/>
Pinnaces, wherewith they now entred <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> and landed with the ſtrength afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ordering the Pinnaces to be there again four days after. And being inform'd that the carriages went dayly from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> through the Woods toward the high-way, they marched as in their former Journey to <hi>Panama,</hi> it being reckoned five Leagues by Sea between <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> but by land they found it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Seven, proceeding on with much ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and order to the great wonder of the <hi>French</hi> Captain, who doubted of ever recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Pinnaces if the <hi>Symerons</hi> ſhould leave them, which <hi>Drake</hi> never ſuſpected, as knowing his will was a Law to them, though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regarded nor truſted the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming within a Mile of the High-way they refreſht themſelves all night, hearing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Carpenters working on the Ships, (becauſe of the great heat of the day) at <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> Next morning <hi>April</hi> 1. 1573. they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rejoiced to hear the Mules coming with a great noiſe of Bells, hoping though they were formerly diſappointed they ſhould now have more Gold and Silver than they could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away as accordingly happened, for ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came three Recoes, one of fifty Mules, and two more of 70 in each Company, every one carrying three hundred pound weight of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amounting in all to about thirty Tun, they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56659:40"/>
ſoon prepared to go into the High-way to hear the Bells, and ſeized upon the firſt and laſt Mules to ſee what metal they carried; Theſe three Recoes had a Guard of about five and forty Souldiers, fifteen to each, which cauſed the exchange of ſome Shot and Arrows at firſt, wherein the <hi>French</hi> Captain was ſore wounded with Hail-ſhot in the Belly, and one <hi>Symeron</hi> ſlain, but the Souldiers ſoon retiring for more help, left their Mules, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took pains to eaſe ſome of them of their burdens, and being weary, contented themſelves with as many bars and wedges of Gold as they could well carry away, burying above fifteen Tun of Silver in the Sand and under old Trees. Having in two hours ended their buſineſs they prepared to return the ſame way, when they heard both Horſe and Foot coming, who yet never followed them into the Woods, where the <hi>French</hi> Captain not able to travel further for his wound, repoſed himſelf ſome time in hope to recover his ſtrength, and one of the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers being miſſing, upon ſearch it was found that being over-loaden with Wine and Gold, he had loſt himſelf in the Woods and was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that Evening, who upon torture diſcovered where they had hid their Treaſure.</p>
               <p>They continued their march all that day and the next to <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi> in hope to meet their Pinnaces, whither being come <hi>April</hi>

looking out to Sea they ſaw ſeven <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces that had been ſearching all the Coaſts thereabout; Upon which they much doubted their own Pinnaces were burnt or taken, ſince <hi>Drake</hi> had ſo ſtrictly charged them to repair hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this afternoon from the <hi>Cabezas</hi> where they lay, and from whence theſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels ſeem'd now to come.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56659:41"/>
judging they would Anchor there, put his Raft aſhoar, and ran by land about the Point, where he ſound them, who joyfully took them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, for <hi>Drake</hi> to try their haſt, ran with all ſpeed as if purſued by the enemy, which they rather believed by ſeeing ſo few with him; Coming aboard, and they asking how his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany did, he coldly anſwered, <hi>Well,</hi> which made them fear the worſt, to remove which, and free them from doubts, he took out of his boſom a Quoit or Wedge of Gold, and thankt God his Voyage was now made; Telling the <hi>French</hi> their Captain was left behind much wounded, with two of his Company, which yet ſhould be no damage to them; That night with much pains they got to <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> where they took the reſt in with their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and made ſuch expedition that by break of day they fayled back to their Frigot and from thence directly to their Ships, where the Captain divided the Gold and Silver by weight into two equal parts between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>Fourteen days after all things being ſet in order, and having taken out of the Ship all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for their Frigot, they reſtored her to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whom they had kept aboard all this time, and then ſailed with the <hi>French</hi> Ship to the <hi>Cabezas,</hi> where <hi>Drake</hi> agreed with the <hi>Symerons</hi> that twelve <hi>Engliſh</hi> and ſixteen of theirs ſhould make another Adventure to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56659:43"/>
where putting their Maiz aſhoar, they ſtayed ſeven days fitting and providing their two Frigots, plucking their Pinnaces to pieces that the <hi>Symerons</hi> might have the Iron-work which they much value; Two days before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture <hi>Drake</hi> deſired <hi>Pedro,</hi> and three of the Chief <hi>Symerons</hi> to go aboard his two Frigots and take what they liked, ſo it were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for their Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> and the Captain preſented them with ſeveral Silks and Linnen for their Wives; Whilſt they were looking in the Trunks, the <hi>Cymeter</hi> Captain <hi>Tetu</hi> had given <hi>Drake</hi> was taken out, which <hi>Pedro</hi> ſeeing he valued it above all things in the World, yet doubting to ask it leſt the Captain ſhould likewiſe prize it, he promiſed <hi>Francis Tucker</hi> a Wedge of Gold to move him about it, and offered the Captain four Wedges more which he had hidden till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voyage; <hi>Drake</hi> though unwilling to make ſuch an exchange, yet deſirous to content him who had deſerved ſo well, gave it him with many kind expreſſions, who received it with ſuch joy that he affirmed, <hi>If he ſhould give his Wife and Children whom he loved dearly in lieu of it he could not ſufficiently recompence him, ſince he would preſent his King therewith, whom he knew would make him a Great Man for the ſake of this very Gift;</hi> Yet inſtead of this unvaluable Jewel he obliged the Captain to accept the four pieces of Gold as a pledge
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56659:43"/>
of his thanks and faithfulneſs to him during life; The Captain received it courteouſly, but threw it into the common Stock, ſaying, <hi>That if they had not come to this place they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have attained ſuch a valuable Commodity, and it was juſt that thoſe who bore part of the charge with him in ſetting him to Sea ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enjoy their full proportion of the advantage at his return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus with all manner of kindneſs they took leave of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and ſayling by Cape <hi>Anthony</hi> came to the <hi>Havana,</hi> where they met with a ſmall Bark with two or three hundred Hides, which was of very much uſe to them in mending their Pumps and otherwiſe, which having lightned they gave the Bark as uſeleſs to the owners to carry them home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Cape <hi>Anthony</hi> they landed, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with ſtore of Turtles Eggs by day, and taking two hundred and fifty Turtles by night, which being powdered and dryed did them much ſervice.

               <p>CAptain <hi>Drake</hi> having in his former Voyage had a View, and only a View of the South <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean from the high Tree afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and from that very time being very ambitious of ſailing thereon in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, he retained this Noble reſolution within himſelf for ſome years, being partly prevented by ſecret envy at home, and partly by applying himſelf to the publick ſervice of his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in <hi>Ireland</hi> under the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere; But in 1577. having a gracious Commiſſion from his Soveraign, and aſſiſted with divers of his Friends who were Adventurers with him, he fitted up five Ships; 1. The <hi>Pellican</hi> Admiral of a hundred Tuns, <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Captain General; 2. The <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral eighty Tuns, <hi>John Winter</hi> Captain; 3. The <hi>Marigold</hi> a Bark of eighty Tun; <hi>John Thomas</hi> Captain; 4. The <hi>Swan</hi> a Flyboat
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56659:46"/>
of fifty Tuns, <hi>John Cheſter</hi> Captain. 5. The <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> a Pinnace of fifteen Tuns, <hi>Thomas Moon</hi> Captain. Having mann'd this little Fleet with a hundred and ſixty four able men, and furniſht them with all neceſſary Proviſions for ſo long and dangerous a Voyage, and ſtowing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pinnaces aboard in pieces, to be ſet up on occaſion, as in his former Voyage, yea carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him ſeveral Muſicians for delight, and rich furniture of Silver for his Table, and Cook-room, with all ſorts of curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip for Ornament, and to raiſe admiration of the Civility and Magnificence of his Native Countrey in other Nations where he came.</p>
               <p>Thus appointed, they ſailed out of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Sound <hi>Novem.</hi> 15. 1577. about five in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and next morning came to the <hi>Lizzard,</hi> where meeting contrary Winds, they were all compell'd to put into <hi>Falmouth.</hi> Next day a great ſtorm aroſe, ſo that though they were in a good Harbor, yet the Admiral wherein <hi>Drake</hi> was, and the <hi>Marigold</hi> were forc't to cut their Main Maſts by the board, and oblig'd to return to <hi>Plymouth</hi> to repair, thirteen days after their departure thence, where having quickly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all defects they <hi>Decem.</hi> 13. once more put to Sea with better hopes; Being out of ſight of Land, <hi>Drake</hi> gave ſome intimation of his deſign (which he had hitherto concealed) both by the courſe he ſaild, and appointing their Randezvouz, if ſeparated by any accident,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56659:46"/>
to be the Iſle of <hi>Mogadore;</hi> Sailing then with a favourable Wind <hi>Decem.</hi> 25. being <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> day they had ſight of Cape <hi>Cantin</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> and of the high in-land Countrey, in thirty two degrees and thirteen minutes North latitude, and coaſting thence Southward about eighteen Leagues, they arrived that day at the Iſle of <hi>Mogadore,</hi> which is under the King of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and a good Harbor, being about a Mile from the main Land, uninhabited, and a League in circuit, overgrown with ſhrubs and full of Pigeons, and therefore much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by Goſhawks and other Brids of Prey, with plenty of ſeveral ſorts of Sea-Fowl; At the South ſide are three hollow Rocks, under which are great ſtore of very ugly, yet very wholeſom Fiſh; Sending a Boat to ſound the Harbor, all their Fleet came in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 27. and ſtaid about four days, ſetting up one of their four Pinnaces brought from home in pieces. The Inhabitants of the Countrey ſoon perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and made ſigns on the Shoar to come aboard, to whom the General ſent a Boat, wherein two Chief <hi>Moors</hi> were received, and one of theirs left in exchange till their return; <hi>Drake</hi> treated them very civilly aboard his Ship, preſenting them with what they ſeem'd moſt to value, to ſhew they came in Peace and Friendſhip to Trade for ſuch Traffick as their Countrey afforded according to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wherewith they ſeem'd much pleaſed,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56659:47"/>
promiſing to return again the next day to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their Goods for others; By their Law they ought to drink no Wine, being <hi>Turks</hi> in Religion, yet they will drink it very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by ſtealth as it now appeared. Being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſhoar they freely reſtored the Perſon left as a pledge, returning with Camels next day at the hour appointed as if loaden with Goods for Exchange, and calling haſtily for a Boat had one ſent by the Generals Order before he went from the Iſland; The Boat coming to a place of Landing among the Rocks, one <hi>John Fry,</hi> ſuſpecting no treachery, readily ſtept out of the Boat to be a pledge as the day before, when thoſe on the Shoar inſtantly ſeizing him, and others in ambuſh coming to their aſſiſtance, they ſpeedily carried him away, the reſt being glad to ſhift for themſelves; The cauſe of this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was to inform the King of <hi>Feſſe</hi> whither this Fleet was bound, or come from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> or what Intelligence they could give him; <hi>Fry</hi> being brought into the Kings preſence, and declaring they were <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> bound for the <hi>Straights</hi> under General <hi>Drake,</hi> he was ſent back with a Preſent to his Captain, and offers of all Kindneſs and Friendſhip in that Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drake</hi> much diſturbed at this injury, landed his men in his Pinnace, and marcht pretty far up into the Countrey without reſiſtance, the <hi>Moors</hi> declining any ingagement with him, ſo

that making proviſion of Wood, and viſiting an old Fort formerly built by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> but ruined by the King of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> he departed <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. toward <hi>Cape Blank,</hi> ſo that when <hi>Fry</hi> came back, he to his great grief found the Fleet gone, yet by the Kings favour he was after ſent home in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Ship, Meeting with foul weather they were detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometime, and the third day after fell with <hi>Cape de Guerre</hi> in 30 degrees, where they took three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fiſher-boats called <hi>Caunters,</hi> whom they carried to <hi>Rio del Oro</hi> under the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> and there took a <hi>Carvel;</hi> From hence <hi>Jan.</hi> 15. they ſailed to <hi>Cape Barbas,</hi> where the <hi>Marygold</hi> took another <hi>Carvel,</hi> it lyes in 20 degrees 30 minutes, low and ſandy, where they firſt obſerved the South Stars called the <hi>Croſiers</hi> 19 degrees 30 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes above the Horizon; In the Cape they took another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship riding at Anchor (all her men but two being fled aſhoar in the Boat) whom with all the reſt formerly taken they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Harbor three Leagues within the Cape.</p>
               <p>Here General <hi>Drake</hi> reſolved to ſtay ſome time to refreſh his men with the plenty of freſh Victuals in this place, and to ſupply them at Sea, there being great ſtore of Fiſh eaſily taken even within the Harbor, and as good as any in the World; During their abode here, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being aſhoar was viſited by the People of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56659:48"/>
the Countrey, who brought down a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Woman with her little Babe hanging at her dry Breaſt, being ſcarce alive her ſelf, and therefore unlike to nouriſh that, whom they would have ſold as a Horſe or Cow, which Merchandize <hi>Drake</hi> not dealing in, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Amber-greeſe and ſome curious Gums to exchange with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for freſh water, of which they have great want, and were willing to quench their thirſt at any price whatever, and to carry the reſt in their Leathern Bags for that purpoſe. <hi>Drake</hi> compaſſionating their unhappineſs, gave them freely what water they deſired, and fed them with Victuals which they devoured in an inhumane and loathſom manner.</p>
               <p>Their Ships waſht and trimm'd, and all their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes diſcharged except one <hi>Caunter,</hi> for which they gave the Fiſherman the <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> one of their own Ships; And a Carvel bound for St. <hi>Jago</hi> being here freed alſo, after ſix days ſtay they ſailed for the Iſlands of <hi>Cape Verde, Jan,</hi> 22. where they were obliged to furniſh themſelves plentifully with water ſince the General intended to run a long courſe from thence, even to the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> without touching land; And having the Wind gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally North-Eaſt <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. they coaſted <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naviſta</hi> and next day anchored at the Iſle of <hi>May</hi> in fifteen degrees, high land, and inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> where landing and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56659:48"/>
to traffick with the Inhabitants for freſh water, they found in the Town near the Shore only a great many ruinous houſes and a poor Chappel, but no people, nor Water, though within the Land there is enough. The Springs and Wells here being ſtopt up and no quantity of water to be found, they marched forward to ſeek for a ſupply finding the Soil fruitful and plenty of Fig-trees with fruit thereon, and in the Valleys were little low Cottages with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Vineyards yeilding excellent Grapes, alſo Coco Trees, Plantains and other Fruits, ſome ripe, ſome rotten, and others bloſſoming, and this in <hi>January,</hi> becauſe the Sun never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws its heat from them, nor have they ever any great cold or froſt. They found good Water in divers places but ſo far from the Shore they could not convey it to their Ships, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple refuſing any conference with them, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves in the ſweet Vallies among the Hills where their Towns were, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them freely to ſurvey the Iſland, ſince they were like to receive more damage than profit to offer violence to thoſe who came peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably among them. The Iſland yeilds vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Goats and Wild Hens, and Salt made without labour by the flowing of the Sea, and the heat of the Sun, which naturally produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a great quantity thereof, lying openly upon the Sands for all that come, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the people drive a great trade with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Iſlands.</p>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56659:49"/>Sailing hence <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. they paſſed next day by the Iſle of St. <hi>Jago</hi> ten Leagues Weſt of <hi>May</hi> in the ſame latitude, inhabited both by <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Portugueſs,</hi> occaſioned by the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Portugals</hi> toward the ſlaves which was ſo intollerable that many fled from their Maſters to the hilly parts of the Iſland, and their number increaſing by the eſcapes they dayly made, grew at length ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they are now a terror to their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors from whom they receive dayly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries either in their Goods or Cattel, and have loſt a great part of that large and fruitful Iſle which is a relief to all Ships bound for <hi>Braſil, Guinea</hi> or the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> being alſo of great ſtrength were it not for the cauſe aforeſaid, which hath much abated the pride of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> who under pretence of Trade and Friendſhip excluded the firſt Planters thereof both from Government, Liberty, and almoſt Life. South-weſt of this Iſle they took a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Ship loaden with Wine, ſtore of Linnen and Woollen Cloth, and other Goods bound for <hi>Braſile</hi> with many Merchants and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aboard; As they went hence three Towns in ſight of them ſhot off two great Guns into the Sea, either for joy of their departure, or to ſhew they were provided to entertain them, and were anſwered with one from the Fleet. South-weſt about twelve Leagues hence yet for its height not ſeeming above three, lies <hi>Fogo</hi> a

burning Iſland or Fiery Furnace, wherein riſes a ſteep Hill thought at leaſt eighteen <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles high, belching out great and dreadful Flames of Fire from the top, almoſt every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, that in the night it gives light like the Moon, and ſeems to reach the very Heavens; It throws out great Stones, which falling into the Sea are uſed as Pumice Stones; The reſt of the Iſland is peopled with <hi>Portugals</hi> who live happily therein.</p>
               <p>Two Leagues hence lyes another Sweet and Pleaſant Iſland called <hi>Brava,</hi> the Trees always green, and is almoſt planted all over with Trees, and Fruits, as <hi>Figs, Coco's, Plantains, Oranges, Lemmons, Cotton,</hi> and the like, with Streams of freſh water running into the Sea and eaſily taken up by Boats and Pinnaces, but there is no Road nor Anchoring for Ships, no ground being to be found by the longeſt Line, ſo that the Sea is thought as deep as <hi>Fogo</hi> is high; They found only one Hermit inhabiting this Iſland, nor ſaw any Houſe but his, who delighted ſo much in ſolitarineſs that he fled from them, leaving behind the Relicks of his Worſhip, that is a Croſs, a Crucifix, an Altar with another above it, and certain Images of Wood of rude Workmanſhip. They here diſcharg'd the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> taken near St. <hi>Jago,</hi> giving them a new Pinnace built at <hi>Mogadore</hi> inſtead of their old Ship, with Victuals and Proviſion.</p>

During which long paſſage on the vaſt Ocean, having nothing but Sea below and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, they ſaw and experienced the goodneſs of Divine Providence in making am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Proviſion for all their wants, and though they oft met with contrary Winds, and Storms, unwelcom calms and burning heats in this Torrid Zone, with the terrors of dreadful Thunder and Lightning, yet they could not but take notice that not having been throughly furniſhed with Water ſince they came from <hi>England</hi> till they arrived at the <hi>River of Plate</hi> long after, yet for 17 days together their neceſſities were conſtantly ſupplyed by Rain-Water, neither was their Fleet (now ſix in number) ever diſperſt, nor loſt company except the <hi>Portugal</hi> Prize for one day only, which yet much diſcouraged them, having the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their drink aboard her, and was therefore found again with much joy ſince her miſcarriage might have defeated the whole Voyage. Among many ſtrange Creatures they particularly obſerved the <hi>Flying Fiſh,</hi> as big as a Pilchard, whoſe Fins are as long as his Body, and ſerve for wings when he is chaſed by the <hi>Boneto</hi> or great Mackrell (whom the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin

likewiſe purſues) for when weary of Swiming, be lifts up himſelf above Water and Flyes pretty high, falling ſometimes into Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that Sail by; The Fins are ſo curiouſly placed as might ſerve for a longer and higher flight, did not their dryneſs after ten or twelve ſtrokes hinder their motion, and force them into the Water to moiſten them; Their increaſe is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, their young ones lying upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Sun as duſt on the Earth, where when no bigger than a wheat Straw they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves both to fly and ſwim, and were they not ſo numerous would ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by their many Enemies, for by flying into the Air to eſcape one, they oft meet death from another adverſary, the <hi>Spurkite</hi> a ravenous Fowl who feeding on Fiſh, ſeizeth on them in their flight, and makes great deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them; There is another ſort called the <hi>Cuttle Fiſh</hi> whoſe Bones are us'd by Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, a multitude falling oft at once into their Ships amongſt their men.</p>
               <p>Sailing thus with as much pleaſure as if in a Garden, in beholding the excellent works of the Eternal God in the Seas, <hi>April,</hi> 5. they fell on the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> in 31 degrees of South-Latitude, and being diſcried by the Inhabitants, they ſaw great Fires in divers places which they underſtood were made for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the Devil, wherein they uſe many Ceremonies and Conjurations by caſting up
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56659:51"/>
great heaps of Sand, that if any Ships ſtay on their Coaſts, their Evil Spirits may deſtroy them, whereof the <hi>Portugals</hi> had experience by loſing ſeveral Ships; <hi>Magellane</hi> in his Voyage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, they pray to nothing but are abſolutely barbarous, but it ſeems they are much altered ſince his time, falling from natural Creatures to make Gods of Devils, yet it may be they being then a free people had no occaſion to practiſe this wickedneſs, but being now in miſerable ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the <hi>Portugals</hi> as to Body, Goods, Wives and Children, and forc't by their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into the barren parts or their Countrey, chuſing rather to ſtarve or linger out a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life there than endure ſuch intollerable Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they may now uſe theſe practices with the Devil to be reveng'd of their Oppreſſors, and to prevent their further entrance into their Countrey, and judging the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be ſome of their Enemies they uſed the ſame Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, yet without effect, for though they had great ſtorms on theſe Coaſts, they received no damage, only <hi>April</hi> 7. a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tempeſt and South-wind directly againſt them, ſeparated one of their Ships for a while from the reſt of the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Keeping on their courſe South, <hi>April</hi> 14. they paſſed by <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi> in 35 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees near the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Plate,</hi> and came to an Anchor in a place which their General named <hi>Cape Joy,</hi> becauſe here the <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> that was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56659:51"/>
ſeparated came to them again; He always took ſpecial care to keep his Fleet as much as poſſible together, to be well furniſhed with freſh water, and to refreſh his men as oft as he could; And therefore at <hi>Cape Verde</hi> he gave publick notice that the next Randezvouz (if diſperſt,) and place of watering ſhould be the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Plate,</hi> and accordingly they here joined and were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all conveniencies, the Air of this Countrey being Pleaſant and Temperate, and the Soil fruitful, ſtored with plenty of large and mighty Deer. <hi>April</hi> 16. they ſailed twelve Leagues farther to a more commodious Harbor, eſpecially againſt the South-Winds, where they killed divers Seals or Sea-wolves (ſo called by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>) which came to the Rocks in great numbers, they were good meat, and a ſeaſonable ſupply for the future; <hi>April</hi> 20 they ſailed further up the River, and rode in freſh-water, but ſtaid not becauſe of the danger of the Winds and Rocks, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent a fortnight there to their great refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>April</hi> 27. they went to Sea again, and that very night the <hi>Swan</hi> their Fly-boat loſt Company, and ſoon after by another Storm the <hi>Caunter</hi> was miſſing; To prevent which for the future the General reſolved to diminiſh the number of his Ships, that they might the better keep Company, and have more ſupplies of Proviſion and Men, eſpecially ſince it was now Winter in theſe parts, and theſe Seas ſubject to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56659:52"/>
terrible Tempeſts, and therefore ſought out a convenient Harbor for this purpoſe. <hi>May</hi> 12. they Anchored in a place not very commodious which yet he called <hi>Cape Hope,</hi> but ſeeming to promiſe good Harborage, <hi>Drake</hi> who never truſted any but his own Eyes in dangers, went next day in a Boat into the Bay, and being near the Shore one of the Inhabitants appeared ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſing and dance very pleaſantly to the noiſe of a Rattle he had in his hand, earneſtly expecting their landing; Upon which there inſtantly roſe ſo thick a Miſt and Fog, with ſuch an extraordinary Storm, that <hi>Drake</hi> being three Leagues from his Ship thought beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and not venture to Land, but the Fog much increaſing he could not ſee where his Ship lay, and was thereby in much danger, when Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> gallantly Adventured into the Bay and finding him out, joyfully received him into his Ship, where they rid ſafely; But thoſe that lay without were ſo furiouſly aſſaulted by the Tempeſt, that to ſecure themſelves they were forced to go off to Sea, the <hi>Caunter</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly loſt now coming in to them. Next day <hi>May</hi> 14. 1578. the weather being calm, and the Fleet out of ſight, General <hi>Drake</hi> now in the <hi>Marygold</hi> went aſhoar, and made Fires to direct them to come together again into the Road, whereby at laſt they all returned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Swan</hi> loſt long before, and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Prize the <hi>Mary,</hi> who was not found a great while after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56659:52"/>In this place the people flying up into the Countrey for fear of them, they found in Houſes built near the Rocks to that purpoſe at leaſt fifty dried Oſtriches and much other Fowl drying, which they dry here and after carry to their dwellings; The Oſtriches Thighs were as big as a common Leg of Mutton, they cannot fly but run ſo ſwift that they can neither be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken nor ſhot at; They found the tools wherewith the Natives take them, and among others a large plume of Feathers at the end of a Staff, the fore-part like the Head, Neck and Body of an Oſtrich ſpreading very broad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which they go Stalking, and drive them into ſome Neck of Land near the Sea where ſpreading ſong and ſtrong Nets, they have Dogs that ſeize on them. The Countrey ſeems very pleaſant and fruitful, and at their return that way, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> became familiarly acquainted with the People, who much rejoiced at their friendſhip, and that they had not harmed them. But the place not being convenient for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Wood, Water and the like, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence <hi>May</hi> 15. and Sailing South-Weſt fell into a very uſeful Bay where they ſtaid fifteen days; From hence the General ſent Captain <hi>Winter</hi> in the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſeek for the two Ships that were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, himſelf going North upon the ſame account who happily met with the <hi>Swan</hi> the ſame day, and bringing her into harbor being unloaden

ſhe was broken up, and made fire-wood, the Iron-work and other neceſſaries being ſaved, but could hear no news of the other.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſtay here, being aſhoar in an Iſland nigh the Main Land, and from whence at low water they might go over a foot, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants appeared, leaping, dancing, holding up their hands, and making out-cryes after their manner, but it being then high water the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſent them by a Boat ſome Knives, Bells, Bugles, and other things he thought would pleaſe them; Upon which getting together on a Hill half a Mile from the Shoar, two of their Company came down ſwiftly though with a great grace ſuch as they uſe in time of Wars, but drawing nigh they made a ſtand, upon which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tying the things to a Staff, ſtuck it in the ground that they might ſee it, and retired a reaſonable diſtance; Being depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they came and took the things leaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof ſuch Feathers as they wore on their heads, a bone carved like a tooth-pick ſix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long and neatly burniſhed; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the General with divers Gentlemen went over to them, they ſtill remaining on the Hill placed in a rank one of them running from one end to the other Eaſt and Weſt, with his hands over his head, and his body inclining toward the riſing and ſetting Sun, and at every third turn he erected himſelf, vaulting in the Air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the middle of the rank toward the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56659:53"/>
Moon, ſignifying (as they thought) <hi>That they called the Sun and Moon (whom they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as Gods) to witneſs they meant nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them but peace;</hi> But perceiving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came apace forward they ſeemed fearful, to prevent which the General and his Company retired, which ſo confirmed them they were no enemies that divers came down after them without fear, and traded with them, but would receive nothing from them till it was firſt caſt on the ground, the word they uſed for exchange was <hi>Zuſſus,</hi> and <hi>Toyt</hi> to throw it on the ground, if they diſliked any thing they cryed <hi>Coroh Coroh,</hi> with ratling in their throat, their goods were Arrows made of Reeds, Feathers, and the Bones aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. They go naked except only a Furr about their Shoulders when they ſit or lye in the Gold, but at other times it is a girdle about their Loyns; Their Hair is very long, which to prevent trouble thy knit up with a Roll of Oſtrich Feathers, and ſerves them for a Quiver for their Arrows, and a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe for what they carry about them; Thoſe of Quality wear a large plain Feather on each ſide their heads ſeeming afar off like Horns, ſo that a head thus trim'd upon a naked body reſembles a Devil with horns.</p>
               <p>Their chief bravery conſiſts in painting their Bodys with divers Colours, with ſuch works as they fancy; Some waſh their faces
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56659:54"/>
with Sulphur or the like, others paint their whole Bodys Black, leaving only their necks round about White, and ſhew like Ladys with black Gowns and naked Necks; Some paint one Shoulder black and another white, and likewiſe their Legs, ſetting white Moons on the black part, and black on the white, being the marks of the Gods they adore; By this continual painting the pores of their Bodys are ſo cloſed they never feel any cold, they are ſtrong, comely, ſwift, and active, and are much to be lamented that being of tractable natures, and in an excellent ſoyl they are ignorant of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God, for though they never knew any Chriſtians before, yet they ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo familiar, that they ſeem'd rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve and do them all good Offices than offer any injury. The General beſtowing a Cap off his head on one of their Chiefs, he going at a diſtance ſuddenly pierced his Leg deeply with an Arrow, ſo that the Bloud ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, he thereby ſignifi'd his unfained love to him, and was as a Covenant of peace between them, they were about fifty perſons who thus frequented their company; In the South part of this Bay is a River of freſh Water, and ſeveral Iſlands full of Seals, Birds and Fowls, ſufficient to maintain a multitude of people, of which they killed ſome with Shot and Staves, and took many Birds with their hands, they light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Heads and Shouldiers; They
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56659:54"/>
ſaw no Boat or Canoo uſed by the Natives to come to theſe Iſles, their own proviſion ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Raw Fleſh and Fiſh, they finding pieces of <hi>Seals</hi> all Bloudy which they had gnawn with their teeth like Dogs; They are all armed with a Bow an Ell long, and Arrows of Reeds headed with Flints very exactly. This Bay they named <hi>Seal Bay</hi> for the plenty of them found here, killing two hundred in an hours time.</p>
               <p>Sufficiently provided with all neceſſaries they ſailed hence <hi>June</hi> 12. South-ward, and anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two days in a little Bay, where they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and laid up the <hi>Caunter</hi> or <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and <hi>June</hi> 14. arrived at another Bay in fifty degrees twenty minutes South-Latitude and within one degree of the mouth of the <hi>Streights,</hi> through which lay their deſired Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the South Sea. Here the General turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Courſe Northerly in hope of finding his Ship and Friends loſt in the great ſtorm, ſince if they ſhould paſs the <hi>Streights</hi> without them, both might be much diſcomforted. So that <hi>June</hi> 18. putting again to Sea with hearty prayers to God for Succeſs, they ran back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Line, and the next night near <hi>Port</hi> St. <hi>Julian</hi> had ſight of their Ship, and the day after the whole Fleet entred joyfully into that Port to refit and refreſh this Ship and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men; St. <hi>Julian</hi> is in 49 degrees, 30 minutes being a very convenient Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56659:55"/>
having many Iſlands within it; Coming now to an Anchor, and all things made ſafe, the General, with his Brother and five others, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual care and diligence on ſuch occaſions) rowed further into the Bay in a Boat to find out ſome convenient place for freſh Water and Proviſions during their ſtay, and were no ſooner landed when two of the Natives viſited them, called by <hi>Magellane Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoures</hi> for their huge Stature and Strength, who ſeem'd much to rejoice at their Arrival, familiarly receiving whatever the General gave them, and much pleaſed to ſee <hi>Oliver</hi> the Maſter-Gunner ſhoot an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arrow, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to out-ſhoot him, but came nothing near him; Soon after another arrived who ſeem'd angry at the Civility of his fellows, and ſtrove earneſtly to make them become enemies, which General <hi>Drake</hi> not ſuſpecting uſed them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> thinking alſo to ſhoot an Arrow, that he who came laſt might ſee it, the ſtring of his Bow broke, which being before their terror, did now incourage them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive treachery againſt them, not imagining their Guns and Swords were Weapons of War, and therefore as they were quietly returning to their Boat theſe Villains ſuddainly diſcharged their Arrows at their backs, aiming chiefly at him who had the Bow, and not ſuffering him to ſtring it again by wounding him in the Shouldier, who turning about was ſhot with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56659:55"/>
an Arrow through the Lungs, yet fell not, but the Gummer being ready to ſhoot off his Musket which took not fire, was ſlain outright. In this extremity their expert General gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that no man ſhould keep any certain ground, but ſhifting places and defending themſelves with their Targets ſhould approach theſe Monſters, and break all the Arrows ſhot at them, knowing when they were ſpent they ſhould ſubdue them at pleaſure, with this wiſe courſe, and by ſhooting off the peice the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner could not fire, the General killed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the quarrel who ſlew the Gunner; for the Musket being charged with a Bullet and Hail Shot tore out his Belly and Guts with much torment, as it ſeemed by his roaring which was ſo Horrid and Hideous as if ten Bulls had bellowed at once; This ſo diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Companions, that though divers others appeared out of the Woods to aſſiſt them, yet they were glad to fly and ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> quietly to depart, which they the rather did, becauſe of Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> who was wounded, and whom the General dearly loved, and would rather have ſaved then ſlain an hundred ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but being paſt recovery he died two days after he was brought aboard. Next day the General in his Boat well armed, went again aſhour to bring off the Gunners body which they found lying where it was left, only ſtript of its upper Garment, with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arrow
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56659:56"/>
ſtruck in his right Eye; Both the dead Bodys were laid in one grave, with ſuch decency and reverence as becomes the Tabernacles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, and ſuch ceremonies as Souldiers in time of War deſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magellane</hi> was not altogether deceived in calling them Giants, ſince they differ ſo much from other men in ſtature, ſtrength and the hideouſneſs of their voice, yet are they not ſo Monſtrous as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reported, ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men being full as tall as any they ſaw, but not imagining any <hi>Engliſh</hi> would ever come there, it incouraged them boldly to write ſuch untruths; Their name <hi>Pentagones</hi> or <hi>five Cubits,</hi> that is ſeven foot and an half, giving their true height, yet many not ſo large; But certainly the Cruelties uſed againſt them have made them more Monſtrous in their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners than Bodys, which being told from Father to Son, has created ſuch an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hatred in them againſt Strangers, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions they ſeek revenge upon them; Yet they ſeemed to repent the wrong offered the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſuffering them to continue there peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably two months after, &amp; may cauſe them to be kinder to others that happen into their Countrey.</p>
               <p>To this miſchief from Infidels another grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of far worſe conſequence was like to have fallen out among themſelves had not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence timely diſcovered and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, whereby the innocent bloud of their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56659:56"/>
General, and his moſt faithful Friends might have been treacherouſly ſhed, and the whole Action thereby overthrown. The deſign was laid before their coming from <hi>England,</hi> and of which General <hi>Drake</hi> had a full account in his Garden at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> but he could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Perſon whom he ſo dearly affected, and had ſo extreamly obliged would contrive any evil againſt him, and therefore continued his favours to this ſuſpected Perſon, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed them ſo as to make him his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and boſom Friend, giving him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place in his Company in his preſence, and leaving him the conduct of his whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in his abſence, imparting to him all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and allowing him free liberty in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable things, yea bearing with his many weakneſſes and infirmities, ſcorning that any private injury ſhould break that firm friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he had contracted with him, and was therefore offended with thoſe who from duty diſcovered his dayly contrivances to deſtroy the whole Enterprize; But the General being at length convinc't of his falſhood, and that lenity would do no good, ſince the heat of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not be allayed but by the murther and bloud of his Captain and Companions, his practices growing dayly more dangerous, he reſolved to queſtion him before it was too late; Therefore firſt ſecuring him, he called all the Commanders and Gentlemen of his Company
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56659:57"/>
together, to whom he gave an account of the good parts in this Gentleman, and of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly tenderneſs he had always ſhewed toward him ever ſince his firſt acquaintance; And then delivered them the Letters he had received from ſeveral Perſons who much doubted his fidelity, and that not only at Sea but at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> not only by bare words, but writings under the Gentlemans own hand, yea ſeveral unworthy actions committed by him tending to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Voyage in hand, and the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Generals Perſon. For all which ſo many full and evident proofs were produced that the Gentleman himſelf ſtruck with remorſe for his inconſiderate and unkind dealings freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged himſelf worthy of death, yea of many deaths, ſince he had not only deſigned the ruin of the Action, but of the principal Actor likewiſe, not of a Stranger or Enemy to him, but of a true and real freind, and therefore openly beſought the whole Aſſembly who had power to adminiſter Juſtice, to prevent him from being his own Executioner, by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to a deſerved death.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe raiſed admiration and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all preſent, eſpecially in his neareſt Friends and deareſt Acquaintance, but none was ſo much affected as the General himſelf, who unable to conceal his tender affection, withdrew, requiring them when they had throughly heard and conſidered the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56659:57"/>
to give ſuch Judgment as they would be anſwerable for to their Prince, but eſpecially to Almighty God the righteous Judg of all the Earth; Whereupon all of them, being 40 of the principal Perſons in the whole Fleet, after they had maturely diſcuſt the buſineſs, and freely heard what any of his friends could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage on his behalf, gave this ſentence under their Hands and Seals, <hi>That this Gentleman had deſerved Death, and that it did by no means conſiſt with their ſafety to let him live, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the manner and circumſtances thereof to the General himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Tribunal was held in one of the Iſlands in the <hi>Port of</hi> St. <hi>Julian,</hi> which was after in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory hereof called <hi>The Iſland of True Juſtice and Jugdment.</hi> After this verdict was given to the General, to whom the Queen had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Sword of Juſtice for the ſafety of himſelf and company with this expreſſion, <hi>We do account that he which ſtrikes at thee</hi> Drake, <hi>ſtriketh at us;</hi> He called the guilty Perſon, to whom was read the aforeſaid verdict which he acknowledged moſt juſt, none giving a more ſevere ſentence againſt him than himſelf, the General then propoſed to him this threefold Choice; <hi>Whether he would be executed in this Iſland; Or be ſet aſhoar on the Main Land;</hi> Or elſe return into <hi>England</hi> and anſwer his crimes before the Queen and her Council; He gave hamble thanks to the General for this undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56659:58"/>
clemency, and deſired time till next day to conſider what to chuſe, which granted, on the morrow he gave this reſult, <hi>That though in his heart he had conceived ſo great a ſin, and for which he was now juſtly condemn'd, yet his chiefeſt care and concern was to dye a Chriſtian, that whatever became of his mortal Body he might remain aſſured of an eternal inheritance in a far better life; That if he were ſet a land among Infidels, he much doubted whether he ſhould be able to continue ſtedfaſt in the Faith conſidering his own frailty, and the great contagion of leud cuſtom;</hi> And therefore he earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the General, <hi>That he would have a ſpecial regard to his Soul, and not indanger it among Heatheniſh and Savage Infidels; That if he ſhould return to</hi> England <hi>he muſt have a Ship, with Men and Victuals, to conduct it, and if he had theſe, yet he thought none would willingly accompany him with ſo ſad and baſe a Meſſage, and leave ſuch honourable ſervice as they were now in; But if he could find ſuch who would be perſwaded to go back with him, yet the very ſhame of his return would be grievous, yea worſe than death to him, ſince he ſhould dye ſo often, and be ſo long a dying;</hi> He therefore proteſted; <hi>That freely and with all his heart he imbrac'd the Generals firſt propoſal of being exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted there, deſiring only the favour that they might receive the Holy Communion together once before his death, and that he might dye the death of a Gentleman.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> General <hi>Drake</hi> in purſuance of his Voyage round the World, paſſeth through the <hi>Streigths</hi> of <hi>Magellane</hi> into the South Sea where he meets with a terrible Tempeſt for <hi>52</hi> days together, and loſes company of two of his Ships; Being left alone he proceeds toward the Coaſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> and gets a Prodigious quantity of Gold and Silver and Jewels.</head>
               <p>THis Tragedy thus ended, the General broke up the <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Portugal</hi> Prize being leaky and troubleſom, leaving her Ribbs and Keel on the Iſland, where for two months
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56659:59"/>
they pitched their Tents, and having wooded, watred, and trimm'd their Ships which were now reduced to three (beſides the Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) to keep the eaſier together, and to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided and mann'd upon all occaſions, <hi>Aug.</hi> 17. they ſailed out of this Port, and with much hope directed their courſe for the <hi>Streights,</hi> South-Weſt. <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. they fell with a Cape nigh the entrance, called by the <hi>Spaniards Cape Virgin Maria,</hi> appearing like <hi>Cape Vincent</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> with ſteep Cliffs and black Stars, againſt which the Sea beating, ſeems like the Spouting of Whales; Here the General cauſed his Fleet to ſtrike their topſails in honour of the Queen, and to acknowledge her abſolute right in this New Diſcovery; Changing alſo the name of his Ship from the <hi>Pellican</hi> to the <hi>Golden Hind,</hi> in remembrance of his honourable Friend Sir <hi>Chr. Hatton,</hi> when after a Sermon and Prayers for the Queen and the whole Realm of <hi>England,</hi> they entred the <hi>Streights</hi> having ſight of Land on both ſides, which at length grew very narrow with many windings, after which they ſeemed to come out of a River two Leagues broad into a large and open Sea, and the night following ſaw a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſland much like <hi>Fogo</hi> in height, and flaming without intermiſſion. It was formerly thought that the current in this <hi>Streight</hi> ran al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one way, but they found the ebb and floud and the water riſing five fathoms upright as on other Coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56659:60"/>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. being <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day they fell with three Iſlands lying triangular, one very large and fruitful, where the weather being calm the General and ſome of his Company went aſhoar and took poſſeſſion thereof in the Queens name, calling it <hi>Elizabeth Iſland;</hi> And though the other two were not ſo large, yet they were very uſeful to them for the great ſtore of ſtrange Birds found there, they could not fly but ran ſo faſt as ſometimes to eſcape, ſomewhat leſs than a Gooſe, ſhort and thick, without Feathers, but only had matted Down, with Bills like Crows; They lay their eggs and breed their young in the ground like Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and live on what they catch in the Sea, being very ſwift Swimmers both to get their prey, and ſecure themſelves from others; They came thither in ſuch vaſt numbers that they killed three thouſand in one day, and are wholſom food, they named one of theſe Iſlands <hi>Bartholomew</hi> according to the day, and the other St. <hi>George</hi> in honour of <hi>England,</hi> wherein they found the body of a man almoſt rotten. From hence to the entrance of the South-Sea the paſſage is very crooked, ſo that they oft met with contrary Winds, being many times forc't to alter their courſe, and though (as <hi>Magellane</hi> ſaith) there be many good Harbors, and ſtore of freſh Water, yet they had need be well furniſhed with Cables and Anchors to find ground in them; The Land on both ſides is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56659:60"/>
very high and mountainous, having on the North and Weſt the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and on the South and Eaſt nothing but Iſlands, among which lye innumerable paſſages into the <hi>South Sea.</hi> The Mountains riſe into the Air with vaſt lofty Spires invironed with Clouds &amp; Snow, which ſtill increaſeth their height, the Sun hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little power to diminiſh them ſo that they may be reckoned among the Wonders of the World; Yet there are many low fruitful Valleys full of Graſs and Heards of very ſtrange crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures feeding therein; The Trees are almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Green, the Air temperate, the Water pleaſant, and the Soil agreeable to any Grain of our Countrey, and indeed wanting nothing to make it an happy Region but the Peoples knowing and worſhiping the true God; They made Fires as they paſſed in divers places.</p>
               <p>Drawing nigh the entrance of the <hi>South Sea</hi> they had ſuch ſhuttings up North-ward, and ſuch open paſſages to the South, that lying at anchor under an Iſland, the General went in a Boat to make further diſcovery, and having found a convenient way toward the North, in their return they met a Canoo with divers Perſons in her, ſhe was made of the Barks of Trees with a Prow and Stern ſtanding up, and bending inward like an half Moon, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Shape and Workmanſhip, and built with ſo much judgment and Art that ſhe ſeemed fit
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56659:61"/>
for the pleaſure of a Prince rather than the uſe of ſuch a rude and barbarous People, the ſeams were not cloſed nor caulked but only ſticht with thongs of <hi>Seal</hi> Skin ſo very cloſe that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived little or no water. The People are of a well ſet mean Stature, delighting much in painting their faces like the other, and had a Houſe within the Iſland built with Poles and covered with Skins of Beaſts, wherein there was fire, water and ſuch Victuals as they can get, as <hi>Seals, Muſſels</hi> and the like, the Veſſels wherein they keep their Water and Drink are of Wood like their Canoos and very neat, which they cut with Knives made of huge Muſſel Shells (the Fiſh being good ſavoury meat) which after they have broken off the thin edge they grind and temper ſo hard upon Stones that it will eaſily cut the hardeſt Wood, and whereof they make Fiſgigs to kill Fiſh with admirable dexterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. They left theſe troubleſom Iſlands and entred the <hi>South Sea</hi> or <hi>Maredel Zur,</hi> the General deſigning to have gone aſhoar at the Cape, and after a Sermon to have left a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Monument of the Queen (which he had prepared) thereon, but they could find no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring, neither would the wind permit them to ſtay; They found the <hi>Streight</hi> was in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 53 degrees, a hundred and fifty Leagues long and 10 broad at the entrance, after not above a League, and then larger again, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56659:61"/>
at the end no <hi>Streight</hi> at all but only Iſlands; The General perceiving that the cold Winter had impaired ſome of his men, reſolved to have haſtned toward the Line and the warm Sun, but it pleaſed God to diſappoint him; For <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. the ſecond day after their entrance into this <hi>Peacable,</hi> but to them now <hi>Furious Sea,</hi> a terrible Tempeſt aroſe with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that they had little hope of eſcaping, and though <hi>Sept,</hi> 15. the Moon was eclipſed in <hi>Aries</hi> and 3 parts darkened which might ſeem to promiſe ſome change of Weather, yet it brought them no relief, but they continued in a miſerable condition full 52 days together, and theſe furious and extraordinary flaws continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or rather increaſing, cauſed the ſorrowful Separation of Captain <hi>John Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Marygold</hi> from the Fleet <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. at night, whom they never met again though they ſtill hoped to have found them on the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> toward the Equinoctial the randezvouz appointed by the General, ſhe being well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with neceſſaries, and an able Captain with skilful and ſufficient Marriners. From <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. when the ſtorm began, to <hi>Octob.</hi> 7. they could not poſſibly recover Land, being driven to 37 degrees of <hi>South Latitude,</hi> when entring with a ſorry Sail into an Harbor ſomewhat North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that Cape of <hi>America</hi> aforenamed, in hope to enjoy ſome quiet till the ſtorm was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were again aſſaulted with ſo cruel a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56659:62"/>
flaw, that the Admiral with the fury thereof left her Anchor behind, and in departing loſt ſight of the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> their Vice-Admiral, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through negligence, or the earneſtneſs of ſome within her to be eaſed of theſe troubles and at home again, as they after underſtood. For the very next day <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. recovering the mouth of the <hi>Streights</hi> again, they returned the ſame way, and coaſting <hi>Braſile,</hi> arrived in <hi>England June</hi> 2. the year following; So that now the Admirals Ship might well have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her former name, being like a <hi>Pellican</hi> alone in this Wilderneſs of Waters; And though the General diligently ſought the reſt of his Fleet, yet he could not gain the leaſt Intelligence of them.</p>
               <p>From this Bay of parting Friends, they were forcibly driven back to 55 degrees, and ran in among the Iſlands aforementioned on the South of <hi>America,</hi> where the paſſage was very large, and continued here quietly two days, finding divers wholſom Herbs and freſh Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the men, before weak and impaired, began to recover, eſpecially by drinking of an Herb like <hi>Penny-leaf,</hi> which gently purging, much refreſht their wearied ſickly Bodys; But the Winds then again returned to their former fury, it ſeeming as if the Bowels of the Earth had been ſet at liberty, and all the Clouds under Heaven ſummoned together into one place, the Seas, by nature heavy, being now rouled up from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56659:62"/>
depths of the Rocks like a Parchment, and carried aloft into the Air like Snow by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Winds to the tops of thoſe lofty Mountains, their Anchors (like falſe Friends) forſaking their hold-faſt, and ſeeming to hide themſelves and ſhrink to the Bottom to avoid the horror of this woful Tempeſt, leaving the diſtreſſed Ship and Men to the uncertain roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seas which toſſed them even like a Tennis-Ball; In this extremity it ſignified nothing to let fall more Anchors, ſince the depth was ſo immenſurable that five hundred fathom would reach no ground, ſo that the inveterate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rage of the Sea, the impoſſibility of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring, or of ſpreading a Sail, the dangerous Rocks and Shelves, the difficulty of continuing there, the inevitable peril of getting out, in ſhort the woful calamitys wherewith they were incompaſſed on every ſide, afforded them very little hope of eſcaping utter deſtruction had not Divine providence ſupported their ſinking Spirits, it ſeeming as likely that the Mountains ſhould have been rent in ſunder from the Top to the Bottom and thrown head-long into the Sea by theſe prodigious Winds, as that the help of all the men in the World could have ſaved any of their lives. Yet that God of mercy who delivered <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the Whales Belly, whom not only Winds and Seas but even Devils themſelves and the powers of Hell obey, who hearkens to the Prayers and Tears
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56659:63"/>
of all that ſincerely call upon him in diſtreſs, even he lookt down and delivered them, ſo that except the fear and aſtoniſhment at their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they received no damage in any thing that belonged to them, in ſuch a dreadful Tempeſt, as the like is not recorded in any Hiſtory ſince <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud.</p>
               <p>The Storm being ſomewhat allayed, they ran in again among thoſe Iſlands from whence they were lately driven, not far from their former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring, hoping now at length for ſome peace and ſecurity there, eſpecially ſince they ſaw the Natives going from one Iſland to another in their Canoo's, both Men, Women, and Young Infants hanging at their Mothers backs, to get a livelyhood by trading with chains of certain Shells and other trifles; Having had a breathing-time here for three days only, which they imployed in providing what they wanted though with much trouble and danger from the tempeſt not quite ſtilled, when behold it again recovered its former rage with much more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, driving them from their Anchors, and aſſaulting them in all Quarters at once, and at length chaſing them to the utmoſt Land toward the <hi>South Pole,</hi> even to 56 degrees, beyond which no Continent nor Iſland is to be ſeen, but the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean and <hi>South Sea</hi> meet freely and openly. Some have imagined theſe Iſlands were <hi>Main Land</hi> and called them <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> or, <hi>The Unknown World,</hi> wherein
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56659:63"/>
were many ſtrange Monſters, which they now ſaw to be altogether falſe, as likewiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the impoſſibility of returning out of the <hi>South</hi> into the Weſt Ocean becauſe of the ſtrong Currents and Winds, ſince they met with neither, but were oft in danger of being driven back, as well as in going forward, and many times were forced to alter their courſe loſing more ſometimes in one afternoon than they could recover again in an whole day with a reaſonable gale, and ſince the narrowneſs of the Paſſage is reckoned the cauſe of this ſwift current, they now obſerved that the Paſſages through were innumerable, and Southward of theſe Iſlands there is a large and main Sea.</p>
               <p>Coming to the utmoſt part of theſe Iſlands <hi>Oct.</hi> 28. the Storm ceaſed, and all their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities except the abſence of their Friends were forgotten; As if God had ſecretly intended they ſhould make this diſcovery, and did then ſtay his hand and refreſh his Servants; In theſe Southerly parts the night in the latter end of <hi>October</hi> was but two hours long; There are few of theſe Iſlands but are inhabited and live after the ſame manner as thoſe aforenamed; The General gave one name to them all calling them <hi>Elizabethides;</hi> After two days <hi>Oct.</hi> 30. they Sailed North-Weſt along the Coaſts of <hi>Peru,</hi> haſting to the height of 30 degrees being the place appointed for the Fleet to reaſſemble, and to ſeek for them in the mean time. In this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56659:64"/>
courſe they next day met with two Iſlands ſtored with Birds of which they made plentiful proviſion from whence <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. they ſteered North-Weſt as formerly, but ſoon found the miſtake of the Maps in deſcribing the Latitude of thoſe Coaſts; This part of <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Lima</hi> 12 Degrees South, is Mountainous and barren without either Water or Wood except in ſome few places inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and not hearing of their Ships they Anchored <hi>Nov.</hi> 15. at a great Iſland called <hi>Mucho</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for its largeneſs, very fruitful of Sheep and other Cattle, ſtored with <hi>Maiz, Potatoes</hi> and other Roots, and thought to be wonderful rich in Gold, wanting nothing fit for the uſe of man. The Inhabitants are thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> who by the horrid ſeverities of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been driven from the Continent to ſecure and fortifie themſelves here; With this People General <hi>Drake</hi> thought fit to Traffick for freſh Victuals and Water, and therefore that very night ſome of the Company going aſhore, they very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly came and brought the beſt Victuals and Proviſions they had, preſenting the General with two very fat Sheep, who returned them many neceſſary things, aſſuring them that he came only to exchange ſuch Goods with them as he wanted and they could well ſpare, and chiefly ſuch as they had already brought them, except freſh water which they deſired them to bring; whereat they ſeemed very well pleaſed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56659:64"/>
and extream joyful at their coming, promiſing to direct them where to have freſh water next morning, and that they would bring any thing elſe they wanted.</p>
               <p>Next morning early, the General having prepared all things ready for Traffick, and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to bring the water, ſet two of his men aſhore to go to the watering place, aſſigned the night before, who paſſed quietly half the way, but were then violently aſſaulted and ſlain by theſe treacherous people, and in hope to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the General with the reſt, about five hundred of them prepared for miſchief, lay in ambuſh behind the Rocks, who ſuddenly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on them, the Rocks being very dangerous for Boats, and the paſſage very open to the Sea, they wounded every man of the Company with their Arrows, <hi>Drake</hi> himſelf being ſhot in the Face under his right Eye very deep, and in his Head to the great indangering of his Life; The reſt there being nine Perſons in the Boat were grievouſly wounded, and the Chief Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon being dead, and his Mate abſent in the Vice-Admiral, none but a Boy being left, their caſe was very deſperate, yet by the help of God and the aſſiſtance of the reſt they all eſcaped. The cauſe of this injury from theſe Iſlanders proceeded from their hatred to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> for their cruelties toward them, and ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> word <hi>aqua</hi> in requiring water, they ſuppoſed them of that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56659:65"/>
Nation, and therefore uſed this outrage toward them; The General left the revenge of this wrong to Heaven, wiſhing only they might be ſenſible whom they had abuſed, not an Enemy but thoſe who would rather have defended them from the injuries of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſailed thence that Afternoon, approaching now the place appointed for meeting the reſt of their Ships, and to find a conveniency for repoſing their wounded men, and ſupplying them with neceſſaries, and at length <hi>Novem.</hi> 30. they fell in with a place called <hi>Philips</hi> Bay in about 32 degrees, and inſtantly ſent out a Boat for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, who after diligent ſearch could find no appearance of relief, diſcovering only the heads of wild Beaſts but no ſign of any Inhabitant thereabout.</p>
               <p>Yet in their return they perceived an <hi>Indian</hi> Fiſhing in a Canoe within the Bay whom they brought aboard the General, he was a proper comely Perſon clothed in a white Garment reaching almoſt to his Knees, his Arms and Head were bare, his Hair very long, but without a Beard, as moſt <hi>Indians</hi> are, ſeeming to be of a mild temper, apprehenſive to learn every thing, and very thankful for what the General beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, and diſcovering in his carriage the harmleſs diſpoſition of the Natives, and how unjuſtly they have been abuſed by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> After he had been kindly treated, and furniſht with what they had, giving what he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56659:65"/>
thought convenient in exchange, he was freely diſmiſt in their Boat, with his own Canoo made of Reeds, and when landed, deſired the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> to ſtay till his return, who being met by two or three of his Friends, ſhewed them the Gifts he had received, wherewith they were ſo pleaſed, that in a few hours he with ſeveral others, whereof one ſeemed of Quality, came and brought them Hens, Eggs, and a fat Hog, all which they ſent in a Canoo to their Boat then at ſome diſtance from ſhore, and to aſſure them of their faithful meaning the Captain hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent back his Horſe, reſolv'd to commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their fidelity of theſe ſtrangers and to go with them alone to their General. By whom they underſtood that there was no relief to be had here, but offered to be there Pilot to a good Harbor Southward, where by way of traffick they might have freſh Water and all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; This offer was readily accepted by the General, the place deſcribed being near that where he had appointed his Fleet to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz; Omitting therefore their deſign of Hunting and Killing ſome of the Buffolo, they by the conduct of this New <hi>Indian</hi> Pilot came <hi>Decem.</hi> 5. into the deſired Port.</p>
               <p>This Harbor is called by the <hi>Spaniards Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pevizo,</hi> and the Town adjoining is St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Chinly,</hi> in 35 degrees 40 minutes, where though they heard nothing of their Ships, yet were fully ſupplyed with all neceſſarys in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56659:66"/>
and amongſt others they found in the Town divers Store-houſes of <hi>Chily</hi> Wines, and a Ship in the Harbor called <hi>The Grand Captain of the South and Admiral to the Iſlands of Solomon</hi> loaden with the ſame liquors, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a quantity of fine Gold of <hi>Baldivia,</hi> and a great Crucifix of Gold beſet with Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds; They ſpent ſome time in refreſhing themſelves and eaſing this Ship of ſo heavy a burthen, and being ſufficiently ſtored with Wine, Bread, Bacon and the like for a long ſeaſon, <hi>Decem.</hi> 8. they ſailed back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Equinoctial Line, with their <hi>Indian</hi> Pilot whom the General bountifully rewarded, and landed at the place he deſired. Having thus ſupplyed their wants, their next care was to regain if poſſible the company of their Ships ſo long ſeparated from them, to which the General applyed his utmoſt endeavour, and ſince it was inconvenient to ſearch every Creek and Harbor with their little Boat, which might happen to fall into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands who would ſhew them no mercy, he therefore ſought out ſome ſafe Harbor to erect a Pinnace, wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indangering their Ship they might leave no place unſought to find out their Countrymen again.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Decem.</hi> 19. they entred a Bay South of the Town of <hi>Cyppo</hi> inhabited by <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in 29 degrees, where having landed fourteen men to ſearch for a conveniency, they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56659:66"/>
were diſcovered by the Town, who inſtantly ſent out three hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> on Horſe back againſt them, and about 200 <hi>Indians</hi> running all naked and in miſerable ſlavery, like Dogs at their heels, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> perceiving their danger eſcaped firſt to a Rock in the Sea, and from thence to their Boat, where they were received and conveyed out of the reach of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fury, without hurt to any but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one <hi>John Minevy</hi> who careleſs of his ſafety, would not be perſwaded to ſave himſelf, but reſolved ſingly to defy and terrify three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, or elſe dye on the place, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly happened, for being quickly ſlain, his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ad Body was drawn by the <hi>Indians</hi> from the Rock to the ſhoar, and there valiantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> his right hand cut off and his heart pluckt out, which they carried away in their ſight cauſing the <hi>Indians</hi> to ſhoot his Body full of Arrows made the ſame day of green Wood, and ſo left it to be devoured of beaſts, had not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> again gone aſhoar and buried it; This ſufficiently diſcovers the barbarity of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their continual dread of a forreign invaſion, or to have their throats cut by the wretched unfortunate Natives whom they never ſuffer to keep any arms but juſt for preſent ſervice, as appears by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows made that very day, and the report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who knew it to be true; Yea they think themſelves very kind if they do not dayly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56659:67"/>
whip theſe Wretches with Cords only for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or drop ſcalding Bacon on their naked Bodys which is the leaſt torture they uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon theſe unhappy <hi>Indians.</hi>

               <p>This not being the place they looked for, nor the entertainment they deſired, <hi>Decem.</hi> 20. they fell into a more convenient Harbor North of <hi>Cyppo</hi> in 27 degrees 55 minutes South latitude, where they ſtaid ſome time to trim their Ship and build their Pinnace, yet ſtill reflecting on the abſence of their Friends, General <hi>Drake</hi> having fitted all to his mind, and leaving his Ship at anchor in the Bay, reſolved to go in the Pinnace himſelf with ſome choice men, toward the South if poſſible to find them out, but after one days Sail the Wind forced him back again; Within this Bay they had ſtore of Fiſh like a Gurnet, and never met with the like except at <hi>Cape Blank</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> the Gentlemen with four or five Hooks and Lines taking in two or three hours four hundred of them. Having diſpatcht their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, <hi>Jan.</hi> 22. they came to an Iſland in the Province of <hi>Mormorena,</hi> where they found <hi>Indians</hi> in Canoos who undertook to bring them to a watering place, upon which the General according to his uſe to ſtrangers treated them nobly and came where they directed, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelled a long way on the land, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed found freſh Water but hardly ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56659:67"/>Sailing along continually in ſearch of freſh Water, they came to a place called <hi>Tarapaca,</hi> and landing lighted on a Souldier aſleep, who had lying by him thirteen Bars of Silver, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about four thouſand <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Duccats, they would not willingly have diſturb'd him, but ſince they did him that injury, they freed him of this charge which might otherwiſe have kept him waking, leaving him if he pleaſed to take another nap more ſecurely; Continuing ſtill their ſearch for Water they again landed not far thence, and met with a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> Boy driving eight Lambs or <hi>Peruvian</hi> Sheep each carrying two leather bags with fifty pound weight of refined Silver, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to ſee a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman turn Carrier, they without asking offered him their Service and became his Drovers, only they miſt his way, for almoſt as ſoon as he parted from them they came into their Boats. Beyond this lye certain <hi>Indian</hi> Towns from whence many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came in Boats made of Seals Skins and blown full of Wind which rows ſwiftly and carries a great Burthen; Theſe ſeeing their Ship, brought ſtore of divers ſorts of Fiſh to traffick with them for Knives, Stones, Glaſſes and the like, men of ſixty or ſeventy years old being as fond of them as if they had purchaſed Jewels of great value. They appeared a plain innocent people, and reſorted to them in great numbers in that ſhort time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56659:68"/>Near this in 22 degrees 30 minutes lay <hi>Marmorena,</hi> and another great <hi>Indian</hi> Town govern'd by two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom deſiring to deal with, <hi>Jan.</hi> 22. they Anchored there, and found them inclined to exchange ſome goods they wanted more out of fear than love, and among others ſome ſuch Sheep as carried the Bags of Silver aforementioned, they are as large as an ordinary Cow, and three Men and a Boy ſate on one of their backs at once, their feet not touching the ground by a foot, nor the Beaſt complaining of its burden, their Necks are like Camels, but their Heads as other Sheep, and are of great uſe to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> their Wooll is very fine and their fleſh good meat, they ſupply the want of Horſes and carry heavy burdens over the mountains 300 Leagues at once, where no other beaſt can travel ſo well; In this place and ſo up through the Province of <hi>Cuſco</hi> the common earth being any where taken up, every hundred pound weight thereof when refined, yields twenty five Shillings of pure Silver at a Crown an Ounce. The next place likely to hear news of their Ships was the Port of <hi>Arica</hi> in 20 degrees there being no harbor in a long way before, where they arrived <hi>Feb.</hi> 7. The Town ſtands in the moſt fruitful ſoil on thoſe Coaſts in the mouth of a pleaſant Valley abounding with all things, having a conſtant trade for ſhipping both from <hi>Lima,</hi> and other places in <hi>Peru,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56659:68"/>
inhabited by <hi>Spaniards;</hi> In two Barks here, they found above 40 Bars of Silver as large as a Brickbat each weighing twenty Pound, which burden having taken upon themſelves they ſailed to <hi>Chowley Feb.</hi> 9. And in their way to <hi>Lima</hi> met with another Bark of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipa,</hi> who had begun to load ſome Gold and Silver, but upon notice of their coming from <hi>Arica</hi> by land, it was again unladen; Yet they took a Bark full of Linnen, which they judg'd uſeful for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. they came to <hi>Lima,</hi> and found thirty Ships in the harbor ſeventeen of them being the beſt in the South-Sea, all ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, yet they had the courage to fall into the midſt of them where they anchored all night, and had they been revengeful could have done the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more miſchief in a few hours than they could have again recovered in many years; But their chief care was to find out their own Company rather than to recompence their cruelty, and though they had no news of them here, yet they had notice of what much elevated them, and ſeem'd to recompence all their labour, namely that here was a Ship of one <hi>Michael Angelo's</hi> wherein were fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bars of Silver, with Silks and Linnen, and a Cheſt full of Royals of Plate, which they quickly took poſſeſſion of. Here they had ſome news from <hi>Europe</hi> and particularly of the death of ſome great Perſons ſince their departure, as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56659:69"/>
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and both the Kings of <hi>Feſſe</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> killed all three in one battle in one day in <hi>Barbary,</hi> the death of the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Pope, and which was more welcom, they had intelligence of a rich Ship gone out of the Haven <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. loaden with Gold and Silver for <hi>Panama.</hi> Therefore next Morning <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. they Sailed when the Wind ſerved, and then towed their Ship toward <hi>Panama</hi> haſtening if poſſible to get ſight of this Gallant Ship the <hi>Caca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogo</hi> the glory of the South-Sea gone from <hi>Lima</hi> fourteen days before; They fell with Cape <hi>Franciſco March.</hi> 1. paſſing the Line the day before, and about noon diſcovered a Sail ahead of them, and having once ſpoke with her they lay ſtill in the ſame place ſix days to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover breath being almoſt ſpent with their haſty purſuit, and to recal what advantage they had made ſince their coming from <hi>Lima.</hi> They had notice of this great Prize ſeveral times, once by a ſhip taken between <hi>Lima</hi> and <hi>Paita;</hi> Again by another ſhip laden with Wines taken in the Port of <hi>Paita,</hi> by a third loaden with tackle, and implements for Ships, with eighty pound weight in Gold from <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil,</hi> and laſtly by <hi>Gabriel Alvarez</hi> whom they met with near the Line, by all whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, they found this Ship to be really the Rich <hi>Cacafogo,</hi> though before they left her a Boy of their own named her the <hi>Cacaplata;</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56659:69"/>
They found in her ſome fruit, Sugar, Meal and other proviſions, but eſpecially that which was the cauſe of her ſlow ſailing, namely a certain quantity of Jewels and Precious ſtone, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cheſts of Riyals of Plate, fourſcore pound Weight of Gold, Twenty ſix Tun of unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Silver, two very large Silver gilt drinking Bowls, and other like trifles valued at about three hundred and ſixty thouſand Pezoes; They gave the Maſter a little Linnen and ſome other things in exchange for theſe goods, and after ſix days bid him farewel; He haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſomewhat lighter, <hi>Panama</hi> and they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off to Sea to conſider whither to ſteer next.</p>
               <p>And now conſidering they were come one degree North of the Line, to the entrance of the Bay of <hi>Panama,</hi> and that there was little hope their loſt Ships ſhould be before them ſince they could get no notice of them in ſo long a courſe and with the ſtricteſt ſearch and inquiry, and that the time of the year drew on wherein their General if ever muſt proſecute his deſign of diſcovering a Paſſage about the North parts of <hi>America</hi> from the South-Sea into our own Ocean, which would be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Countrey for the future, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might have a much nearer Paſſage home; They therefore concluded to find out a convenient place for triming their Ship, and getting Wood, Water and other proviſions aboard, and then to haſten for diſcovering this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56659:70"/>
Paſſage through which they might return with Joy to their much deſired homes; Sailing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>March</hi> 7. toward the Iſle of <hi>Cainos,</hi> they arrived there the 16. ſetling themſelves in a freſh River between that and the Continent for finiſhing their affairs, where there happened a terrible Earthquake, which was ſo violent that the Ship and Pinnace though near an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile from the ſhoar trembled and ſhook as if on dry land; They found here Fiſh, Wood, and freſh Water (beſides Alegators and Monkeys) with many other neceſſaries that they wanted; In their paſſage hither they took one Ship more, which was the laſt they met with on all theſe Coaſts, laden with Linnen, <hi>China</hi> ſilk and <hi>China</hi> diſhes, and a Falcon curiouſly wrought in Gold, with a great Emerauld in the breaſt thereof.</p>
               <p>From hence <hi>March</hi> 25. 1579. they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſail the neareſt courſe the Wind would permit without touching any where in a long way, paſſing by Port <hi>Papagaia;</hi> The <hi>Port</hi> of the <hi>Vale</hi> of the moſt Rich and Excellent Balms of <hi>Jericho, Quantapico</hi> and divers others, as alſo certain Gulphs hereabout, which continually ſend forth ſuch violent winds as much indanger the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships if they go too near. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice that they ſhould oft have calms and contrary winds near the Coaſt, and that if they run off to Sea to avoid them, they could not then meet with Land again when they would;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56659:70"/>
the General thought fit to increaſe their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and therefore at the next Harbor called <hi>Guatulco,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they by trading ſupplyed themſelves with Bread and other neceſſaries, and then departed from the Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> yet not forgetting to take along with them a pot of about a Buſhel full of Ryals of Plate, that they found in the Town, with a Chain of Gold and other Jewels which they intreated a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who was flying away with them to leave behind. Next day <hi>April</hi> 16. they went directly to Sea, ſailing five hundred Leagues in Longitude to get a Wind, and by <hi>June</hi> 3. got fourteen hundred Leagues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into 42 degrees North Latitude, where they felt an extream alteration from heat to cold, which much impaired their healths, made the Ropes of their Ships ſtiff, and the Rain was turned into Hail, ſo that they ſeemed rather in the <hi>Frozen Zone</hi> than ſo near the Sun, and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 2 degrees further the cold increaſed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely that their hands were benum'd, and they durſt hardly bring them from under their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to feed themſelves; Neither could they impute this to the tenderneſs of their Bodies, coming out of thoſe very hot Countreys, ſince their meat almoſt as ſoon as from the Fire was frozen, and their tackle ſo ſtiff, that ſix men were hardly able to perform what was uſually done by three, which very much diſcouraged them, but General <hi>Drake</hi> comforting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56659:71"/>
them to truſt in Gods Providence who never fails his Children, and that they ſhould now quit themſelves like men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this ſhort trouble and extremity with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſince they were ſure thereby to obtain ſpeedy comfort and glory; By ſuch motives as theſe he put new life into them, ſo that every man was armed with a reſolution to ſee the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Diſcovery could be made that way.</p>
               <p>The Land in that part of <hi>America</hi> bearing further Weſt than they imagined, they were nearer to it than they were aware, and yet the cold ſtill increaſed. <hi>June</hi> 5. they were driven by the winds toward the Shore which they then firſt deſcried, and Anchored in a Bay much expoſed to the winds and flaws, and when they ceaſed, there inſtantly followed thick ſtinking Fogs, which nothing but the wind could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and that was always violent. So that not able to ſtay here nor go further Northward for the cold and wind which was full againſt them, getting to Sea they were forcibly carried Southward from 48 to 38 degrees, where they found the Land low and plain, with ſome few Hills covered with Snow; <hi>June</hi> 17. they came to a convenient Harbor and continued there till <hi>July</hi> 23. During which though in the height of Summer yet they had conſtant nipping cold (neither for 14 days could they ſee the Sun for the foggineſs of the Air) which had ſuch influence not only upon their Bodies
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56659:71"/>
who came out of the heat, but on the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants themſelves though accuſtomed thereto, who yet came ſhivering to them in their warm Furs crouding cloſe together to receive heat of each other, the Trees being without Leaves, and the ground without Graſs even in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> the poor Birds and Fowls not dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to riſe from their Neſts (as they oft found) after they had laid their firſt Egg, till they were hatcht, and had got ſome ſtrength, but had this advantage, that their Bodies being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot perfects their young ſooner than in other places; Though the real cauſe of this extremity is uncertain, yet it is judged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the large Continent of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> near together Northward of this place, from whoſe high Mountains always covered with Snow, the Northweſt Winds which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blow on theſe Coaſts bring this almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable ſharpneſs, which the Sun in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heat is not able to diſſolve, from whence the Earth is ſo barren, and the Snow lyes at their doors almoſt in the midſt of Summer, but is never off their Hills, from whence proceeds thoſe ſtinking Fogs through which the Sun cannot pierce, nor draw the vapors higher into the Air, except the fierce winds do ſometimes ſcatter them, and when gone, the Fogs return as before; Some Seamen aboard who had been in <hi>Greenland,</hi> affirmed they never felt ſuch cold in the end of Summer as now in theſe two
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56659:72"/>
hot months, from whence it may be ſuppoſed, there is no paſſage through theſe Northern Seas, or if there be it is unnavigable for the Ice and Cold met with therein; Neither in all their ſailing on theſe Coaſts to 48 degrees could they find the Land bend in the leaſt toward the Eaſt, but running always Northweſt as if it directly met with <hi>Aſia,</hi> and even then when they had a Wind to carry them through, if any ſuch paſſage had been, yet they had a ſmooth Sea and ordinary Tides, which could not have happened had there been a <hi>Streight,</hi> as they concluded there was none.</p>

               <p>NExt day after their coming to Anchor in the Harbor aforementioned, the Natives of the Countrey diſcovering them, ſent a Man to them in a Canoo with all expedition, who began to ſpeak to them at a great diſtance, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56659:72"/>
approaching nearer made a long Solemn Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with many ſigns and geſtures after their manner, moving his hands, and turning his head, and after he had ended, with great ſhew of reſpect and ſubmiſſion return'd again to ſhoar; He repeated the Ceremony a ſecond and third time, bringing with him a bunch of Feathers like thoſe of a black Crow, neatly placed on a ſtring and gathered into a round bundle, exactly cut and equal in length, which (as they underſtood afterward) was a ſpecial Badg worn upon the head of the Guard of the Kings Perſon; He brought alſo a little Basket made of Ruſhes, full of an Herb called <hi>Tabah,</hi> which tyed to a ſhort Rod he caſt into their Boat. The General intended inſtantly to have recompenced him, but could not perſwade him to receive any thing except a Hat thrown out of the Ship into the water, refuſing any thing elſe though it were upon a board thruſt off to him, and ſo preſently return'd; After this their Boat could row no way but they would follow it, ſeeming to adore them as Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 21. Their Ship being leaky came nearer the ſhoar to Land their Goods, but to prevent any ſurprize, the General ſent his men aſhore firſt with all neceſſaries for making Tents and a Fort for ſecuring their purchaſe; Which the Natives obſerving came down haſtily in great numbers with ſuch weapons as they had as if angry, but without the leaſt thought of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56659:73"/>
Hoſtility, for approaching them they ſtood as men raviſhed with admiration at the ſight of ſuch things as they had never before heard nor ſeen, ſeeming rather to reverence them as Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than to deſign War againſt them as Mortal Men, which they diſcovered every day more clearly during their whole time of ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Being directed by ſigns to lay down their Bows and Arrows they immediately obeyed as well as all the reſt who came conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to them, ſo that in a little while there were a great company of Men and Women. To confirm this peace which they ſeemed ſo willing to agree to, the General and his men treated them very courteouſly, beſtowing on them freely what might cover their nakedneſs, and making them ſenſible they were not Gods but Men, and had themſelves need of Garments to cover their ſhame, and perſwading them to put on Cloths, eating and drinking in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to ſatisfie them, that being Men they could not live without it, yet all would not prevail to perſwade them they were not Gods; In recompence of Shirts, Linnen-cloth and the like beſtowed on them, they gave the General and his Company Feathers, Cawls of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, Quivers for Arrows made of Fawn-skins and the Skins of thoſe Beaſts their Women wore on their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Being at length fully contented with view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they return'd with joy to their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56659:73"/>
Houſes, which are dug round within the Earth, and have from the ſurface of the ground poles of Wood ſet up and joined together at the top like a ſpired Steeple, which being covered with Earth, no Water can enter, and are very warm, the door being alſo the Chimney to let out the Smoak, which are made ſlopous like the Scuttle of a Ship; Their Beds are on the hard Ground ſtrowed with Ruſhes with a fire in the midſt round which they lye on, and the roof being low round and cloſe gives a very great reflexion of heat to their Bodys; The men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally go naked, but the Women combing out Bulruſhes make therewith a looſe Garment which tyed round their middle, hangs down about their hipps, and hides what nature would have concealed; They wear likewiſe about their Shoulders a Deers-Skin with the Hair thereon, they are very obedient and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their Husbands, doing nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their command or conſent. Returning to their Houſes, they made a lamentable howling and crying, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> though three quarters of a Mile diſtant heard with wonder, the Women eſpecially extending their voices with doleful ſhreiks.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this ſeeming ſubmiſſion and reſpect, the General having experienc't the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of other Infidels, provided againſt any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of their minds, ſetting up Tents, and intrenching themſelves with Stone-walls; which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56659:74"/>
done, they grew more ſecure. Two days after this firſt Company were gone, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of others, invited by their report, came to viſit them, who as the other, brought Feathers and Bags of <hi>Tabah</hi> for Preſents, or rather for Sacrifices, believing they were Gods; Coming to the top of the Hill, at the bottom whereof they had built their Fort, they made a ſtand, where their Chief Speaker wearied himſelf and them with a long Oration, uſing ſuch violent geſtures, and ſo ſtrong a voice, and ſpeaking ſo faſt that he was quite out of breath; Having done, all the reſt bowed their Bodys very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reverently to the ground, crying <hi>Oh,</hi> as conſenting to all had been ſaid, then leaving their Bows with their Women and Children behind, they came down with their Preſents in ſuch an awful poſture as if they had indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before a Deity, thinking themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to be near General <hi>Drake,</hi> and eſpecially when he accepted what they ſo willingly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, getting as nigh him as poſſible, imagining they approached a God.</p>
               <p>Mean time the Women, as if frantick, uſed unnatural violence to themſelves, ſhreiking dreadfully, and tearing their Cheeks with their Nails till the Bloud ſtreamed down their Breaſts, rending their Garments from the upper parts of their Bodys, and holding their Hands above their Heads, thereby to expoſe their Breaſts to danger, they furiouſly threw themſelves on the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56659:74"/>
ground, not regarding whether it were wet or dry, but daſht their naked Bodys againſt Stones, Hills, Wood, Buſhes, Bryers, or whatever lay in their way, which cruelty they repeated (yea ſome Women with Child) 15 or 16 times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till their ſtrength failed them thereby, which was more grievous to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſee, than to themſelves to ſuffer. This Bloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ended, the General and his Company fell to prayers, and by lifting up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven, ſignified that their God, whom they ought to Worſhip, was above in the Heavens, whom they humbly beſought if it were his pleaſure, to open their Blind Eyes that they might come to the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt; While the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at Prayers, ſinging of Pſalms, and reading ſome Chapters in the Bible they ſate very attentive, and at the end of every pauſe cryed out with one voice, <hi>Oh!</hi> ſeeming to rejoice therein; Yea delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo in their ſinging Pſalms, that after when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they reſorted to them, they deſired this <hi>Gnaah,</hi> or that they ſhould ſing. At their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture they returned all that the General had given them, thinking themſelves ſufficiently happy in having free acceſs to them.</p>
               <p>Three days after <hi>June</hi> 26. the news having ſpread it ſelf farther into the Countrey another greater number of People were aſſembled, and among them their King himſelf, a man of a comely preſence and ſtature, attended with a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56659:75"/>
Guard of an hundred tall ſtout men, having ſent two Ambaſſadors before to tell the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral their <hi>Hioh</hi> or King was coming, one of them in delivering his Meſſage ſpake low, which the other repeated <hi>Verbatim</hi> with a loud voice, wherein they continued about half an hour, which ended they by ſigns deſired ſome preſent to their King to aſſure him of coming in peace, which the General willingly granted, &amp; they joyfully went back to their <hi>Hioh;</hi> While after their King with all his Train appeared in as much pomp as he could, ſome loudly crying and ſinging before him, as they came nearer they ſeemed more grave in their Actions; In the front before him marcht a tall man of a good countenance carrying the Scepter or Mace Royal, of black Wood about a yard and half long, upon which hung two Crowns one leſs than the other with three very long Chains oft doubled, and a bag of the herb <hi>Tabah,</hi> the Crowns were of knitwork wrought curiouſly with feathers of divers Colours, and of a good faſhion, the Chains ſeemed of Bone, the Links being ſmall, thin, and finely burniſht, the number of Links in one Chain was almoſt innumerable, and worn by very few, who are ſtinted to the number, ſome 10, 12, or 20, and as they exceed in Chains are thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more honourable. Next the Scepter-Bearer came the King himſelf with his Guard about him, having on his head a knitwork
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56659:75"/>
Cawl wrought ſomewhat like a Crown, and on his Shoulders a Coat of Rabbits-Skins reaching to his Waſte; The Coats, of his Guard were of the ſame ſhape but other Skins, having Cawls with Feathers, covered with a down growing on a herb exceeding any other down for fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not to be uſed by any but thoſe about the Kings Perſon, who are alſo permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wear a plume of Feathers on their heads in ſign of honour, and the Seeds of this herb are uſed only in Sacrifice to their Gods. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them followed the common people almoſt naked, whoſe long hair tyed up in a bunch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, was ſtuck with plumes of Feathers, but in the fore part only one Feather like an Horn according to their own fancy, their faces were all painted, ſome White, others Black or other Colours, every man bringing ſomething in his Hand for a Preſent; The Reer of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſiſted in Women and Children, each Woman carrying a basket or two with bags of <hi>Tabah,</hi> a Root called <hi>Petah,</hi> (whereof they make bread and eat it either Raw or Baked) broyled Fiſhes like Pilchards, the Seeds and Down aforementioned, and ſuch other things; Their Baskets are made of Ruſhes like a deep Boat, and ſo well wrought as to hold Water, they hang peices of Pearl ſhells, and ſometimes Links of theſe Chains on the brims, to ſignify they were only uſed in the Worſhip of their Gods, they are wrought with matted Down of red Feathers into various forms.</p>

Approaching nearer, and joining cloſer together, they gave them a general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, and after ſilence he who carried the Scepter prompted by another aſſign'd by the King, repeated loudly what the other ſpake low, their Oration laſting half an hour, at the cloſe whereof they uttered a common <hi>Amen,</hi> in approbation thereof; Then the King with the whole number of Men and Women (the little Children only remaining behind) came farther in the ſame Order down to the foot of the Hill near the Fort; When the Scepter-bearer with a compoſed countenance began a Song, and as it were a dance and was followed by the King and all the reſt, but the Women, who were ſilent; They came near in their dance, and the General perceiving their honeſt ſimplicity, let them enter freely within their Bulwark, where continuing a while ſinging and dancing the Women following with their bowls in their hands, their bodies being bruiſed, and their Faces, Breaſts, and other parts torn and ſpotted with Bloud; Being tired with this exerciſe they by ſigns deſired the General to ſit down, to whom their King and others ſeemed to make
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56659:76"/>
ſupplications that he would be the King and Governor of their Countrey to whom they were moſt willing to reſign the Government of themſelves and their Poſterity, and more fully to declare their meaning, the King with all the reſt unanimouſly ſinging a Song, joyfully ſet the Crown on his head, inriching his neck with Chains, offering him many other things, and honouring him with the title of <hi>Hioh,</hi> concluding with a Song and Dance of triumph that they were not only viſited by Gods, (which they ſtill judged them) but that the great god was become their King and Patron, and they now the happieſt people in the World.</p>
               <p>The General obſerving them ſo freely to offer all this to him, was unwilling to diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them ſince he was neceſſitated to continue there ſome time, and to require relief in many things from them, not knowing what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it might in time bring to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; Therefore in the name and for the uſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> he took the Scepter, Crown and Dignity of that Land upon him, wiſhing that the Riches and Treaſures thereof, wherein the upper parts abound, might be as eaſily tranſported hither, as he had obtained the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty thereof from a people who have plenty and are of a very loving and tractable nature, ſeeming ready to imbrace Chriſtianity if it could be preached and made known to them;

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> much grieved at the power of Satan over them, ſhewed all kind of diſlike hereto, by lifting their hands and eyes toward Heaven, but they were ſo mad on their Idolatry that though held from rending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet when at liberty were as violent as before, till thoſe they adored were conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Tents, whom yet as men diſtracted they raged for again. Their madneſs a little qualified, they complained to them of their griefs and diſeaſes, as old Aches, Shrunk Sinews, cankered Sores, Ulcers, and Wounds lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived wherewith divers were afflicted, and mournfully deſired cure from them, making ſigns that if they did but blow upon them or touch their maladies they ſhould be healed. In pity to them, and to ſhow they were but men, they uſed common Ointment and Plaiſters for their relief, beſeeching God to enlighten their minds.</p>
               <p>During their ſtay here they uſually brought Sacrifices every third day till they clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were diſpleaſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

their zeal abated; Yet they continually reſorted to them with ſuch eagerneſs that they oft forgot to provide ſuſtenance for themſelves, ſo that the General whom they counted their Father was forc't to give them Victuals as Muſcles, Seals and the like, wherewith they were extreamly pleaſed, and ſince they would not accept of Sacrifices, they hating ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, forced what they had upon them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, though never ſo uſeful to themſelves; They are very ingenious and free from Guile or Treachery; Their Bows and Arrows (which are their only Weapons and almoſt all their wealth) they uſe very Skilfully yet without much execution they being fitter for Children than Men, though they are uſually ſo ſtrong that one of them could eaſily carry that a mile together without pain which two or three <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> there could hardly bear; They run very ſwift and long, and ſeldom go any other pace; If they ſaw a Fiſh ſo near the ſhore as to reach the place without ſwimming they ſeldom miſt it.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed their Affairs the General and ſome of his Company made a Journey up into the Countrey to obſerve their manner of living, with the Nature and Commodities of the Countrey; They found their Houſes ſuch as you have heard, and many being fixt in one place made divers Villages; The Inland was far different from the Sea ſhore, it being a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56659:78"/>
very fruitful Soil, furniſhed with all neceſſaries and ſtored with large fat Deer, whereof they ſaw thouſands in an Heard, with Rabbits of a ſtrange kind, having tails like Rats and feet like a Mole, with a natural bag under their chin, wherein after they have filled their belly abroad, they put the reſt for relieving their young or themſelves, when they are willing to ſtay at home; They eat their bodies, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Skins, of which the Royal garments of their King are made; This Countrey Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Drake</hi> called <hi>Nova Albion,</hi> both becauſe it had white Cliffs toward the Sea, and that its name might have ſome likeneſs to <hi>England,</hi> which was formerly ſo called. Before they went hence the General cauſed a Monument to be erected, ſignifying that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been there, and aſſerting the right of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Succeſſors to that Kingdom, all ingraven in a Plate of Braſs, and nail'd to a great firm Poſt, with the time of their Arrival, the Queens name, and the free reſignation of the Countrey by the King and People into her hands, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe her Picture and Arms, and underneath the Generals Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had never any commerce nor ever ſet foot in this Countrey, their utmoſt Acquiſitions being many degrees Southward thereof; and now the time of their departure being at hand the joy of the Natives was drowned in extream ſorrow, pouring out wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

complaints and grievous ſighs and tears for their leaving them; yet ſince they could not have their preſence, they (ſuppoſing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be Gods) thought it their duty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to be mindful of them in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, declaring by ſigns that they hoped here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to ſee them again, and before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were aware ſet fire to a Sacrifice which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, burning therein a Chain and a bunch of Feathers; The General endeavoured by all means to hinder their proceedings but could not prevail, till they fell to Prayers and Singing of Pſalms, when allured thereby, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting getting their folly, and leaving their Sacrifice unconſumed and the fire to go out, imitating the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all their actions they lift up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven as they did <hi>July</hi> 23. They took a ſorrowful leave of them, but loth to part with them, they went to the tops of the Hills to keep ſight of them as long as poſſible, making fires before, behind, and on each ſide of them, wherein they ſuppoſed Sacrifices were offered to their happy Voyage.

               <p>The General now finding the extremity of the cold increaſe, the Sun being gone further, and the Winds conſtantly blowing Northerly,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56659:79"/>
giving no hope of finding a Paſſage through thoſe Northern Seas, He reſolved with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approbation of all, to loſe no more time, but Sail directly to the <hi>Molucco</hi> Iſlands; And having a ſight of nothing but Sea and Sky for ſixty eight days together, they continued their courſe through the Main Ocean till <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. when they ſpied certain Iſlands about eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees North of the Line, from whence there came inſtantly a great number of Canoo's, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome four, in others ſix, 14 or 15 men, bringing Coco's Potatoes, Fiſh, and ſeveral fruits to ſell; Their Canoo's are made of one Tree hollowed within very artificially, and as ſmooth as glaſs all over with a very curious prow and ſtern hung full of white glittering ſhells; On each ſide were two peices of Timber about a yard and half long, at the ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great Cane was faſtened to prevent them from overturning. The People had the lower parts of their Ears cut round, and hanging very low on their cheeks wherein they put things of a reaſonable weight, the Nails of ſome of their Fingers were at leaſt an inch long, and their Teeth as black as Ink, occaſioned by eating an herb with a powder they always carry with them to that purpoſe; The firſt company of Canoo's coming up to their Ship which Sailed ſlow for want of Wind, ſeemed very fair dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and exchang'd ſome goods with them very orderly, making ſigns for them to come nearer

the ſhoar, but deſigning treacherouſly to ſeize both Men and Ship. Theſe gone, others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came, who if they got any thing into their Hands would neither return it nor give any thing for it, counting all their own which they once handled, impudently expecting more, but would give back nothing; Upon which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> refuſing to trade with them as Cheats, they were ſo inraged that having Stones in their Canoo they let fly a great many at them. The General ſcorning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this injury, yet to ſhew them he was able, cauſed a great Gun to be diſcharged which had the deſired effect, for they inſtantly leapt out of their Canoo's into the Water, and diving under the Keel of their Boats, ſtaid there till the Ship was gone a good diſtance from them, and then nimbly recovering their Canoo's haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Shoar.</p>
               <p>However new Companys of them ſtill reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ship, and ſince violence would not prevail, pretended now to traffick honeſtly, yet ſtole whatever they could meet with; One pluckt a Dagger and Knives from their mens Girdle, which being again demanded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Menſſenger to the King with a Velvet Cloak for a preſent to aſſure him they came in peace, deſiring nothing but Victuals which he was deſtitute of by his long Voyage, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſome Merchandizes with him, which he did require with the more aſſurance being invited to come hither by the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> who promiſed them all neceſſary proviſions; They found the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> had been with the King, and repreſented to him to what a mighty Prince and Kingdom they belonged, from whom by way of Traffick they might for the future obtain great advantages, and whereby the <hi>Portugals</hi> their Enemies would be much diſcouraged; Whereat the King was ſo much moved, that before the Meſſenger got half way he had ſent the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Nobility and Councellors to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, offering them a ſupply of all they wanted, and declaring the willingneſs of their King to enter into friendſhip and amity with ſo renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prince as theirs was, and if ſhe pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, he would prohibit all other Nations from trading on his Iſland (eſpecially the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> from whom he got nothing but by the Sword) and reſerve it wholly for traffick with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> In token whereof he had now ſent his Signet to the General, and would very ſuddenly come himſelf with his Brethren in his Boats and Canoos to make him a viſit, and to bring his Ship into ſafe Harbor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56659:81"/>While they were delivering this Meſſage to them, their own Meſſenger arrived at Court, who being met by divers Noble Perſons, was with much Solemnity brought into the Kings preſence, by whom he was very graciouſly received, and having delivered his Errand and Preſent to him, he ſeemed to blame himſelf that he had not already attended their General, who came ſo far and from ſo mighty a Monarch, and therefore inſtantly made ready to come with his Councellors; His appearance was very great and ſtrange, as if he deſigned to give extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Honour to their Prince; Before him went three large Canoo's filled with his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all in white Lawn or cloth of <hi>Calecut,</hi> with a Canopy over their Heads of fine thin Matts ſupported with a frame of Reeds; Every one ſate according to his dignity, and the grey Heads of many diſcovered that the King uſed the advice of grave Councellors in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Affairs; There were alſo divers come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy young men under the ſame Canopy, but of an inferior rank, the reſt were Souldiers ſtanding in exact order round about, on the outſide of whom ſate three Rowers in Galleries on each ſide all along the Canoo, three or four yards from it, one being orderly built lower than the other; In every of which Galleries was an equal number of Banks whereon ſate Rowers there being about 80 in one Canoo; In the forepart of each Canoo were two men, one

holding a Tabret and the other a peice of Braſs, whereon they both ſtruck at once with due diſtance between each ſtroke, by the ſound whereof they directed the Rowers to keep time with their Oars, and the Rowers ending their ſtroke with a ſong, warned the others to ſtrike again, and ſo they went very ſwiftly; Every Canoo had a ſmall Gun about a yard long mounted on a Stock ſet upright; and every man except the Rowers was furniſht with Sword, Dagger, and Target, and ſome had Lances, Muskets, Bows, Arrows and many Darts.</p>
               <p>Theſe Canoos coming orderly near the Ship, rowed round about them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bowing their bodies with much reverence as they paſſed by even to the very ground, and putting their own Meſſenger again aboard, ſignified that their King was at hand, having ſent them before to conduct their Ship into a better Road, deſiring them to throw out a Cable whereby they might tow the Ship to the place aſſigned by the King; Who ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ſix grave ancient men in his Canoo, who together with the King, did all at once render them ſuch reſpect as was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them; He was tall, very corpu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent and of a Princely preſence, and ſo highly honoured by his Subjects that neither the Vice Roy of <hi>Mutir</hi> nor any of his Nobility durſ ſpeak to him but on their Knees, nor riſe a gain till he commanded.

pleaſed with this Royal viſit, received them in the beſt manner he could, expreſſing his joy by the thundring of his great Guns mixt with ſtore of ſmall Shot, ſounding of Trumpets and other Muſick both ſmall and loud, wherewith the King was ſo delighted that requeſting their Muſick to come into the Boat, he joined his Canoo thereto and was towed an hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Boat at the Stern of the Ship, the General likewiſe ſending him ſuch further Preſents as might requite what favours he had already received, and confirm that friendſhip begun between them.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeming even raviſhed in this Muſical Paradiſe, his Brother named <hi>Moro</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many gallant followers gave the ſame reſpects to them as before, and then fell aſtern till they came to an anchor, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſenting him alſo with what exceedingly pleaſed him; Being at Anchor, the King askt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that he muſt be gone, and taking his leave, promiſed to come aboard them the next day, and mean time would ſend them what proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they wanted, and accordingly that night and next morning they purchaſed what was to be had by way of Traffick, namely a quantity of <hi>Rice, Hens, Sugar Canes,</hi> liquid <hi>Sugar,</hi> and a fruit named <hi>Figo,</hi> (the ſame the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Plantains) Cocoes,</hi> and a ſort of meal called <hi>Sago</hi> made of the tops of certain Trees, and taſts like ſowr curds, but melts away like Su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gar

               <p>At the time appointed the General having prepared all things ready, expected the King, but he failed both in time and promiſe, ſending his brother to excuſe him, and to deſire him to come aſhoar himſelf, offering to ſtay there for ſecuring his ſafe return; The General upon conſideration of his breaking his word, would by no means truſt himſelf in his power, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hearing ſome ſuſpicious words from his Brother, but keeping the Vice-Roy aboard, ſent ſome of his Gentlemen to Court with the Kings Brother, and a ſpecial Meſſage to the King himſelf; Coming near the Caſtle they were received by another brother of the Kings and other great Perſons, by whom they were conducted to a large fair Houſe wherein were above a thouſand People, the Chief being placed round about the Room according to their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the reſt ſtaying without; The Houſe was four ſquare covered over with cloth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours upon frames of Reeds, open at ſides, with ſeats round about it, being the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Room; At the ſide next the Caſtle was a Chair of State, with a very long rich Canopy over it, the floor being covered 10 or 12 paces about with Cloth of <hi>Arras;</hi> There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

and his Mother living, having a Wife and one Son by her, beloved and highly honoured of all his Subjects, reigning in great peace and without apprehenſion of invaſion from his Neighbours: But it was not this Gentlemans fortune to partake of the happineſs of his King and Countrey as he deſired; For (as he told them) being accuſed of a Capital Crime whereof though free, yet not able to make his innocency evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, and knowing the ſevere Juſtice of <hi>China,</hi> if he ſhould be found guilty by his Judges, he humbly deſired the King would pleaſe to remit his Trial to the Judgment and Providence of God by permitting him to travel, on condition that if he did not return with ſuch remarkable Intelligence as his Majeſty had never heard, and was worth obſervation and for the advantage of <hi>China,</hi> he would forever live in Baniſhment, or elſe ſuffer Death for preſuming to come into his own Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured that the God of Heaven would clear his innocency. The King granted his ſuit, and he had been now three years abroad, and came then from <hi>Tydore</hi> (where he had reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two Months) to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General of whom he had heard very ſtrange things, and from whom he hoped for ſuch Intelligence as might further his return into his own Countrey, beſeeching him to relate the occaſion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his coming ſo far as <hi>England</hi> thither, and what accidents happen'd to him by the way.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56659:85"/>
The General fully ſatisfied his requeſt, and this ſtranger heard his diſcourſe with much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and delight, and having a retentive memory, he ſo firmly imprinted theſe Relations in his mind that with great reverence he gave God thanks, who had brought him to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch admirable occurrences; and then ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated the General to viſit his Country before he went farther Weſt, ſince it would be the moſt pleaſant, honourable, and profitable Voyage he could make, whereby he ſhould carry home an account of one of the ancienteſt and richeſt Kingdoms in the World; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he magnified the greatneſs and number of their Provinces, the ſtatelineſs and riches of their Citys, with the multitude of men, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all manner of proviſions, and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, eſpecially of the number of great Guns in <hi>Quinzai</hi> their cheif City, much eaſier managed than ours, and ſo exact as to hit a Shilling, which he ſaid they invented above two thouſand years ago; With many other things which the General might better obſerve with his Eyes than he could relate, and that the Wind would ſerve very ſhortly to carry them thither, and did not doubt, but it would much advance his Honour with the King to bring ſuch a ſtranger along with him; But all his Arguments having no prevalence on the General, he with grief departed, though very glad of the Intelligence he had learned.</p>

               <p>Having trimmed their Ship, and recovered their health and ſtrength by the excellent plenty of all kind of refreſhments in this place, they only expected the Brize or Trade wind which blows only one way for ſome Months together, and getting in freſh Water and Wood the day before, <hi>Decem.</hi> 12. they ſet ſail Weſtward, and in two days had ſight of the Iſlands of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebes,</hi> but were in ſo much danger from the Shoals and Sands that they beat about till <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. When ſuppoſing they had attained a free paſſage the Land turning viſibly Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Wind reaſonable fair, failing with a full gale without ſuſpition, in the first Watch of the night, their Ship ſuddenly fell upon a deſperate Shoal, and was in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on the point of periſhing in a moment, without ſaving the Lives of any, or the Goods they had ventured ſuch Perils to attain; All now judging it more neceſſary to prepare for another World than imploy their thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing in this; Yet after hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for Deliverance, the General ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorting them to take ſerious care of their Souls, and to contemplate on the joys of

another Life; and not to be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he incouraged them by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ply the Pump and free the Ship from Water, and finding their leaks did not increaſe, it gave them ſome hope that the Bulk was ſound, which they attributed alone to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, ſince no ſtrength of Iron or Wood, could poſſibly have endured ſuch a violent ſhock as their Ship ſuffered if the extraordinary Providence of Heaven had not intervened; Their hope was next to get good ground and anchor-hold, and the General himſelf undertook to Sound, but could find no bottom a Boats length from the Ship, ſo that their growing hopes were hereby quite daſht again, though this diſappointment was concealed from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the men in the Ship, the General ſtill cheering them up with the beſt incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could think of.</p>
               <p>The Ship being ſo faſtened that ſhe could not ſtir, it ſeemed very probable that they muſt either remain on the place with her, or elſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to ſome miſerable place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, which was a very hard choice, and threatened them with a lingring death; The Ship ſeemed to declare to them that ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every minute to be deſtroyed by the Winds and Seas, ſo that if they ſhould eſcape out of her they were like to lead a miſerable life among wild Beaſts or People it may be more barbarous than they, in intollerable Bondage

both of Body and Mind; And if the Ship ſhould ſtill continue undeſtroyed, yet her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions could not laſt many days, and there was no poſſibility of recruiting, ſo that Famine might cauſe them to eat the very Fleſh from their own Arms, which was terrible to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; The hope of eſcaping by leaving her ſeemed yet more improbable, the Boat not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of carrying above twenty Perſons at once, and they were in all fifty eight; The neareſt Land was ſix Leagues thence, and the Wind directly againſt them; and the firſt who had Landed (while they were fetching the reſt) would certainly have fallen into the hand of the Enemy, and gradually all the reſt; But if they ſhould eſcape death, yet the woful Captivity into which they muſt fall, and be thereby deprived of the true Worſhip of God, and continually grieved with the horrible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and deviliſh Idolatries of the Natives would make death more elegible than life.</p>
               <p>The night being ſpent in theſe melancholy thoughts, they rejoyced to ſee the morning, and it being then almoſt full Sea, after humble thanks to the Almighty for preſerving them thus long, and hearty prayers and tears for a bleſſing upon their endeavours they again tryed to find anchor-hold, but found this ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as fruitleſs as the former, ſo that it ſeemed impoſſible their Ship ſhould be ever delivered by any policy or power of man, unleſs God

himſelf ſhould miraculouſly appear for their ſafety, to whoſe omnipotent power and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency they all concluded to refer themſelves, having a Sermon preached to them, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Communion together; After this bleſſed repaſt, not to be wanting in any lawful means for preſerving themſelves they concluded to unload the Ship, which they had hitherto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, wherein they were ſo willingly ingaged, that they ſeemed to deſpiſe what was neceſſary for their defence, yea for ſuſtaining their lives, throwing not only their Ammunition, but their meal for bread into the Sea, being aſſured that if it pleaſed the Lord of Heaven to ſave them, he would fight for them againſt their Enemies, and not ſuffer them to periſh for want of bread; And at length it was God alone that delivered them, for having continued in this miſerable condition firmly fixt in the cleft of a Rock, they found that at low Water it was not above ſix foot deep on the ſtar-board ſide, though at a little diſtance there was no bottom to be found; The Wind during the whole time blew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtiff directly againſt their broad ſide, and thereby forcibly kept their Ship upright; In the beginning of the Tyde while the water was loweſt it pleaſed God to calm the Wind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Veſſel which required 13 foot water to make her ſwim, and had not then above ſeven on one ſide, and wanting the Wind which had been her prop hitherto on the other, ſhe fell

a heeling toward the deep water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by freed her keel, and filled their hearts with joy.</p>
               <p>This Shoal is three or four Leagues in length in two degrees South Latitude, the day of their deliverance was <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. and was the greateſt danger they met with in their whole Voyage, though not the laſt as by the ſequel appears; For a month after they were in continual fear of theſe Shoals and Iſlands, among which they were toſt, and which lye in vaſt numbers round the South of the <hi>Celebes. Jan.</hi> 12. not being able to bear their Sails for fear of Tempeſts and Sands, they anchored upon a Shoal, and two days after on an Iſland, where they ſtaid a day Wooding and Watering; After which they met with foul weather, Weſterly Winds and dangerous Shoals for many days, ſo that being weary of this Coaſt they ſailed for <hi>Timor;</hi> But could not ſo eaſily clear themſelves of the <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> (which lye in five degrees South Latitude) for <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. being forced toward a ſmall Iſland not far thence, and ſending their Boat a good diſtance before to ſearch out a place where to Anchor, there ſuddenly roſe a moſt violent Storm out of the Southweſt, driving them among the perilous and hidden Shoals, ſo that they again counted themſelves loſt, or that they muſt ſpend their days among Infidels, if they ſhould eſcape with their lives, but that God who had hitherto preſerved them, was pleaſed once again to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

The People are Gentiles or Heathens, very comely of body and civil, juſt, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to ſtrangers, ſeeming very glad of their coming, and readily releiving their wants with whatever their Countrey afforded; The men go naked except their Heads and Secrets, every one having ſome thing hanging at their Ears, the Women are clothed from the Waſt to the Feet, wearing abundance of Bracelets (ſome nine and more) upon their naked arms made of

horn of braſs, the lighteſt weighing near two Ounces; They much value Linnen cloth, to make Rolls for their Heads, and Girdles about their middles, and delight in Stones and the like trifles; Their Iſland is rich in Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Copper, Tin and Sulphur, which they work very artificially into divers forms and ſhapes; They have plenty of Nutmegs, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, long Pepper, Lemmons, Cucumbers, Coco's, Figo's, Sagu, and ſeveral other Fruits, whereof they provided themſelves of one like a Bay berry but pleaſant in taſt, and being boyld is very ſoft and nouriſhing meat; They continued here two days, not having found more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreſhment in all their Voyage (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at <hi>Terenate</hi>) as in this place.</p>

                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. Coming to the height of eight degrees four minutes, they ſpied a green Iſland to the South, and ſoon after two more that way, with a large one toward the North, appearing well inhabited, but they had no occaſion to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them, and therefore paſt them by, together with ſeveral others; <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. they Anchored under a little Iſland, but found nothing but Wood and two Turtles; After which they Sailed on Weſtward without ſtay or any thing obſervable till <hi>March</hi> 9. when they ſpied Land, and Anchored that night; Next Morning they bore farther North and came to an Anchor the ſecond time near the ſhoar; <hi>March.</hi> 11. they took in Water, and ſending their Boat

again aſhoar, they traded with the People, and coming nearer the Town, the General ſent his man aſhoar, next day to preſent the King with ſome Silks, and Cloth both Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and Linnen, which he thankfully received, returning Rice, Cocoes, Hens, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in recompence; They found it to be <hi>Java</hi> Iſland in 7 degrees 30 minutes South Latitude; <hi>March.</hi> 13. the General with many of his Gentlemen went aſhoar, and preſented the King with their Muſick, by whom they were very generouſly entertained; They ſhewed him the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline training their Pikes and Muskets before him; They were treated according to their deſire, and at length diſmiſt with a promiſe to have more Victuals ſent them; In this Iſland there is one Principal, but many petty Kings whom they call <hi>Raja's,</hi> that live in much friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with each other; <hi>March.</hi> 14. they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Victuals from two of them, and next day three of theſe Kings came aboard in Perſon to viſit the General, and to view their Ship and Amunition, being much pleaſed with their entertainment, and what they ſaw.</p>
               <p>After they had been with them, and related what they found, <hi>Raja Donan</hi> the Chief Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the whole Iſle came aboard them next day, bringing Victuals for their relief; And few days paſt but one or other of them came, whom the General treated with the beſt cheer he could

make, and ſhewed them all the rarities of their Ship, with their great Guns, Arms and all the furniture thereto belonging, and how they were uſed; Never failing to give them Muſick, wherewith they were equally filled with delight and admiration; <hi>March</hi> 1. <hi>Raja Donan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again aboard, in requital of theirs preſented the General with his Countrey Muſick, which though ſtrange, yet ſeemed very pleaſant; The ſame day he ſent an Ox to the Water ſide, which he was willing to exchange for divers ſorts of coſtly Silks which he much eſteemed; Their Kings as well as the People are kind, true, and exact in their dealings, they traffickt with them for Hens, Goats, Cocoes, Plantanes and other Proviſions whereof they offered them ſuch plenty that if there had been occaſion, they might have laden their Ship with them.</p>

               <p>THis Worthy Knight having performed that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Exploit of incompaſſing the World, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo much reputation thereby that every man thought himſelf happy who was ingaged with this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Commander; Having therefore only enjoyed ſome ſhort breathing ſince his laſt great Adventure, he for the ſervice of his Prince and Country provided a Navy of twenty five Ships and Pinnaces, aboard which were two Thouſand three hundred Mariners and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their reſpective Captains and other Officers both for Land and Sea ſervice; He Imbarqued at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Sept.</hi> 12. 1585. himſelf being General, and Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Carliel</hi> Lieutenant-General, Captain <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Frobiſher</hi> Vice-Admiral, and Captain <hi>Francis Knollis</hi>

Rere-Admiral; Having diſpatched all neceſſary Affairs, they ſailed thence directing their courſe for <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſpied divers ſails near the ſhore, the weather being calm; The Vice-Admiral was ſent with the Pinnaces to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who they were, upon whoſe approach moſt of them left their Ships being <hi>Frenchmen</hi> laden with Salt and homeward bound; Amongſt theſe ſmall Ships the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral took one, which had no man in her, and detained her for his ſervice, reſolving to ſatisfie the Owner, as accordingly he did at his return; He called this Bark the <hi>Drake,</hi> and diſmiſt the reſt being eight or nine in number; ſoon after they met with another <hi>French</hi> Ship laden with Fiſh from <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> whom the General would not ſuffer to be medled with; Next day they deſcried another tall Ship of twelve hundred Tun whom they chaſed and took, finding her to be of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> loaden with poor Jack, which being lawful prize, they diſtributed the Fiſh into the other Ships, and was very ſerviceable during their whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>Two days after they put in within the Iſles of <hi>Bayon</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where part of the Fleet had no ſooner Anchored but the General commanded all the Pinnaces and Ship Boats to be well mann'd, and provided with Arms for preſent ſervice, and putting himſelf in his Galley well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they Rowed toward the City of <hi>Bayon</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſurprize it; When advancing half way an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Merchant was ſent from the Governor to know what ſtrange Fleet they were, who coming to the General, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome brief diſcourſe, he ordered Captain <hi>Sampſon</hi> to go along with the Merchant to the Governour, and deſire him to reſolve two Points. 1. <hi>Whether there were any Wars between</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> England <hi>and if not, then.</hi> 2. <hi>For what reaſon the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Merchants Goods were ſeized and arreſted.</hi> The General in the mean time thought fit not to ſtay for an anſwer, but to Sail up within ſhot of the City, to be ready for any ſudden aſſault upon occaſion, before it was dark; Captain <hi>Sampſon</hi> returned ſoon after with this Reply. <hi>That the Governour ſaid, he knew of no Wars, and that the power of Peace and War did not lye in ſo mean a

ſubject as himſelf, and as for detaining the Merchants Goods, it was done by the Kings command without the leaſt deſign of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaging any, and that about ſeven days ſince he had ſent a countermand, whereby they were now diſcharged;</hi> To verify which he ſent all theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in Town aboard, who affirmed the Truth thereof; Upon which after conſultation it was reſolved, That ſince it was late they would Land their men, and quarter aſhoar that night, taking all neceſſary care to ſecure themſelves; Which done, the Governor ſent them Bread, Wine, Oyl, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Grapes, Marmalade and other refreſhments; About midnight the Weather being overcaſt, they thought it ſafeſt to repair aboard; But before they could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fleet a great Tempeſt aroſe, driving divers Ships from their Anchors; And particularly the <hi>Speed-Well</hi> which was carried into <hi>England,</hi> the reſt being again recovered; This Storm continued three days, after which Mr. <hi>Carlile</hi> was ſent with his own Ship, three others, the Galley and divers Pinnaces to <hi>Vigo</hi> where they took many Boats and Carvels laden with ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable things, eſpecially Houſhold-Stuff going into the high Countrey, and one with Church Ornaments for the Cathedral of <hi>Vigo</hi> wherein they found a great Croſs of Silver imboſſed and double gilt over, of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value, and the Owners complained they loſt here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty thouſand Duckets.</p>
               <p>Next day General <hi>Drake</hi> and the whole Fleet ſailed from the Iſles of <hi>Bayon</hi> to a very good Harbor above <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> where L. General <hi>Carliel</hi> attended his coming, for the conveniency of freſh Water; Mean time the Governor of <hi>Gallicia</hi> having muſtered up two thouſand Foot, and three hundred Horſe, marched with them from <hi>Bayon</hi> to this place, and lay in ſight of the Fleet from whence he ſent to the General to deſire a parlee, which he agreed to ſo it were by Boats in the Water, and pledges being given on each ſide for ſecurity of their Perſons, the Governor and two more came into the Vice-Admirals Skiff which was fear aſhoar to them and the General met them in his own, where it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

concluded, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould have free liberty to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and furniſh themſelves with freſh Water, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarys paying the uſual value for the ſame.</hi> Having diſpatcht all buſineſs here, they proceeded toward the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands about three hundred Leagues from this part of <hi>Spain,</hi> deſigning for the Iſle of <hi>Palma</hi> to furniſh themſelves with ſtore of proviſions which that place abundantly affords, and to have refreſht themſelves with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, but were prevented by the bad entrance into it, which was ſecured with very many great Guns, ſome of which ſhot into their Ships, and likewiſe by the dangerous Seas and Waves toward the Shoar, which threatned the deſtruction of many Boats and Pinnaces.</p>
               <p>Fruſtrated of their deſign here, they fell with the Iſle of <hi>Ferro</hi> in hope of better ſucceſs, and landed a thouſand men in a Valley under an high Mountain, where they ſtaid about three hours, when the Inhabitants accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a young Fellow born in <hi>England,</hi> came to them, and complained they were ſo poor as even ready to ſtarve, which they believed was true, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out getting any thing, were all again commanded to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark, and that night they put off toward the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary; Saturday Nov.</hi> 13. They ſell with <hi>Cape Blank</hi> a low land and ſhallow water where they catcht ſtore of Fiſh, and doubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng the Cape fell into the Bay, they found divers <hi>French</hi> Ships of War, whom they treated kindly and left there, ſailing thence to the Iſles of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. Anchored their whole Fleet between a Town called <hi>Plaie</hi> and St. <hi>Jago</hi> both on that Iſland, putting above a thouſand men aſhoar under L. General <hi>Carlile;</hi> The place where they landed was ſtony and troubleſom, and therefore with much induſtry they marched farther up till they came to a pleaſant plain about two miles from the Town of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> where the L. General having put his men in order, reſolved to attempt nothing till next morning ſince he had no Guide to the place; In the morning half an hour before Sun-riſing he divided his Army into three parts, and by day light advanced in good order toward the Wall of the Town, but found no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

to reſiſt, whereupon Captain <hi>Sampſon</hi> and Captain <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> each with thirty Musketeirs were commanded to go down into the Town, which was in a Valley under them, and from whence they might plainly view it all over; After whom was ſent the great Enſign having nothing in it but the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Croſs which was ordered to be placed in the Fort toward the Sea, that the Fleet might ſee St. <hi>Georges</hi> Croſs Triumphant in the Enemies Fortreſs; Being arrived there all the Inhabitants were fled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the Ordnance about the Town, being above 50 ready charged, were ordered to be ſhot off in honour of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> coming to the Crown that day being <hi>Nov.</hi> 17. according to the Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> which were anſwered by the great Guns from the Fleet, who now approached ſo near that this thundring noiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a great while together. Mean while the L, General continued with the greateſt part of his forces on the top of the Hill till the Town was quartered out for lodging his whole Army, which being done and every Captain ſetled in his own Quarters in the Evening they placed ſuch ſufficient Guards about the Town, as they had no cauſe to fear an Enemy; Here they ſtaid 14 days taking ſuch ſpoils as the place yielded, as Wine, Oyl, Meal, Vinegar, Olives and the like, but no Treaſure, nor any thing elſe of value; The City of St. <hi>Jago</hi> is of a Triangular form, having two rocky Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the Eaſt and Weſt-ſide which ſeem to hang over it, on the top whereof were built certain Fortifications to ſecure it; From thence to the South-ſide of the Town is the main Sea, and on the North the Valley lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Mountains wherein the City ſtands, the diſtance being very narrow between them. Through the midſt of the Valley runs a ſmall Rivolet of freſh Water, which makes a Pond or Pool near the Sea-ſide where their Ships took in water with much conveniency; At the Towns-end the Valley growing larger is converted into Gardens and Orchards, repleniſhed with Lemons, Oranges, Sugar-Canes, Coco-Nuts, Plantains, Potatoes, Cucumbers, Onyons, Garlick, and divers other Fruits, Herbs and Trees.</p>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:56659:95"/>During their ſtay here, a <hi>Portugal</hi> came to the Weſt Fort with a Flag of Truce, to whom were ſent the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Goring,</hi> who firſt askt, <hi>What Nation they were,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> He then inquired, <hi>Whether there were Wars between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Spain, Who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>They knew not but if he would go to their General he would reſolve him of all doubts;</hi> Offering him ſafe conduct, who refuſed as not being ſent by the Governor; They then told him, <hi>That if the Governor deſired the benefit of his people and Countrey he would do beſt to come and preſent himſelf to their Noble and merciful General Sir</hi> Francis Drake <hi>from whom he might be aſſured of favour both for himſelf and the Inhabitants, otherwiſe within three daies they ſhould march over the land and deſtroy all places and people with Fire and Sword;</hi> With this anſwer he departed, promiſing to return next day, but they never heard of him more; <hi>Nov.</hi> 24. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, L.

They again prepared to imbark their Army, ſome being ſent in the mean time to the Town of <hi>Play</hi> or <hi>Praie</hi> to ſearch for Ammunition which a Priſoner taken the day before promiſed to diſcover, but when they came there, either he could or would not do it but ſearching all likely places, they found one Braſs, and another Iron great Gun; In the Afternoon the General and his whole Fleet anchored at <hi>Plaie,</hi> and coming aſhore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town to be burnt, and themſelves to repair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aboard, which being quickly diſpatcht they all imbarked that night, and put off to Sea Southweſt. All the time they were at St. <hi>Jago</hi> neither the Governor

who was a <hi>Portugal,</hi> nor the Biſhop whoſe Authority is great there, nor any of the People ever came (though they expected they would) to deſire them to ſpare their Proviſions, or forbear ruining their Town, which they judged proceeded from their guilt of the treachery and Cruelty uſed toward Mr. <hi>William Hawkins</hi> of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> with whom about five years before, they broke their Faith, and Murthered many of his men, but ſince they came not at them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> left written in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places eſpecially at the <hi>Spittle-houſe,</hi> (which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be ſpared from the Fire) the indignation they had againſt them, not only for not appearing, but for their Barbarous uſage of the Body of one of their Boys, whom they had taken ſtragling, and having beheaded him and taken out his Heart, had in a brutiſh manner ſcattered the reſt of his Limbs about the place; In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of which Savage and Inhumane Villany, they burnt all the Houſes they found in the Country as well as the Town of St. <hi>Jago.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence they ſailed directly toward the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> but had not been many days at Sea, when above three hundred of their men died, though till ſeven or eight days after their coming from St. <hi>Jago</hi> they had not loſt one man in the whole Fleet; They were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an extream burning continual Ague, and ſome ſpots like thoſe of the Plague appeared upon ſome of the dead, thoſe few who eſcaped with life were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in their underſtanding a long time after. In eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days they reached from St. <hi>Jago</hi> to <hi>Dominica,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Iſland they fell with, inhabited by barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People going all naked, and painting themſelves red, the men are perſonable and ſtrong, but hold little correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having then two of that Nation Priſoners, and ſeem a very treacherous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple though they were very ſerviceable to them during their ſhort ſtay, helping their men to bring freſh water on their bare Shoulders from the River to their Boats, and fetching them great ſtore of Tobacco and Caſſavy Bread from their Houſes; and in requital received li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral

rewards of Glaſs, coloured Beads, and other things which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found at St. <hi>Jago,</hi> wherewith they ſeemed much pleaſed, and appeared ſorrowful at their departure.</p>
               <p>From hence they went Weſtward to the Iſle of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> where they ſpent ſome days of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> to refreſh their ſick and cleanſe their Ships, but found no people there; It was here concluded to proceed next to the great Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> incited thereto with the fame of the rich City of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> being the moſt confiderable place on thoſe Coaſts, and to further their purpoſe, they by the way took a ſmall Frigot bound thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and having examined the men, found the Haven was barred, and the Caſtle upon the ſhore well fortified with Artillery, ſo that there was no convenient landing place within ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of the City, to which the Pilot ingaged to bring them; this being reſolved on, next morning early at the ſaid place about ten miles Weſt of that famous City, the Forces who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued into Pinnaces, Boats, and other ſmall Barks appointed for this ſervice, landed under Lieutenant General <hi>Carleil,</hi> and about eight a Clock began to march, approaching the Town toward noon, where they were met by about an hundred Gentlemen of Quality on Horſeback, but the ſmall ſhot played ſo ſmartly upon them that they were obliged to retire, and ſuffer them to proceed to the two Gates of the Town next the Sea, which were guarded with Soldiers and great Guns, with ſome Companies of ſmall ſhot planted in Ambuſcade on the High-way; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> divided their Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in about twelve hundred men into two parts to aſſault both the Gates at once, the L. General publickly declaring to Captain <hi>Powel</hi> that with Gods help he would go on till both Parties met in the Market-place of St. <hi>Domingo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon their approach, the Ordnance were fired upon them which killed one man near the L. General, who not in the leaſt diſmayed, incouraged his men to march on briskly and prevent them from charging again;

which they proſecuted with ſo much vigor, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Ambuſcades, they valiantly entered the City Gates, putting all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to flight, and forthwith repaired to the Market-place, which was a very fair ſquare before the great Church, whither Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Powel</hi> according to agreement ſoon after came; where they ſecured themſelves that night, and about mid-night thoſe in the Caſtle finding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> buſie at the Gates, abandoned it, ſome being taken Priſoners and others eſcaping by Boats to the other ſide the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. At this time General <hi>Drake</hi> ſent a <hi>Negro</hi> Boy with a white Flag, and a Meſſage to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> according to their own uſage, who unhappily meeting with ſome of the Officers belonging to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galley then in Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> one of them was ſo inraged that he thruſt the poor Boy through the Body with an Horſemans ſtaff, who had yet ſtrength enough to return and give the General an account of this Barbarous Act, after which he fell down dead in his preſence, whereat the General was ſo inraged that he ordered three <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Priſoners to be carried to the ſame place and hanged, ſending them word, <hi>That till the Perſon who had murdered their Meſſenger was delivered up to condign puniſhment, he would hang two</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Priſoners every day till they were all diſpatcht;</hi> Upon which the next day the Captain of the Kings Galley brought the Offender to the Towns-end, offering to deliver him into their hands, but they deſired that he might be executed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves in their preſence, thinking it the more honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and ſo Execution was accordingly done upon him.</p>
               <p>In this place (as formerly at St. <hi>Jago</hi>) one of their own Company an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man was executed for Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Corporal. In this time many Propoſals were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Commiſſioners to ſave their City, which not taking effect, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſeveral Mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavoured to fire the high ſtrong Stone-houſes, but with little ſucceſs, though two hundred Mariners were imployed every day to perform it, ſo that at length
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56659:97"/>
wearied with firing, and upon divers other accounts, they were content to accept of twenty five Thouſand Duckets, (each five Shillings ſix Pence in value) as a ranſom for the reſt of the Town; Among other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables in St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> it is obſervable that in the Hall of the Kings Houſe there are the Arms of <hi>Spain</hi> painted in a large Scutcheon, under which is placed a Globe of the whole World, with a Horſe as it were leaping on it, and a ſcrole out of his mouth, wherein was written, <hi>Non ſufficit Orbis, the World ſufficeth not;</hi> which ſufficiently diſcovers the unbounded Ambition of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and the Commiſſioners being deſired by the General to explain the meaning of it, ſhook their heads and ſmiled, ſeeming aſhamed of it, ſince they were told, <hi>That if the Queen of</hi> England <hi>would proſecute the War vigorouſly againſt them, they would find it enough to preſerve what they had got, and not think of gaining more from others, as by the loſs of this famous Town did ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appear;</hi> They found no great Riches in it, which was occaſioned by the Cruelty uſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Natives of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which though almoſt as large as <hi>England,</hi> the People were utterly deſtroyed in a few years by their Tyranny, ſo that for want of men the Mines of Gold and Silver in this Iſland are wholly given over, and they are now forced to uſe only Copper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of which they found a great quantity; Their chief Trade conſiſts in Sugar and Ginger which grow there, and in Ox &amp; Cow Hides who breed in infinite numbers in this waſt Countrey; They have alſo ſtore of ſtrong Wines, ſweet Oils, Vinegar, Olives, Wheat-meal and other Proviſions; with Silks, and Woollen, and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> which were a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to them; They met with but little Plate, becauſe they uſe Porcellane Diſhes for Meat, and Glaſſes to drink in.</p>
               <p>Leaving St. <hi>Domingo</hi> they ſailed along the Coaſt of the Continent, and at length came in ſight of <hi>Carthagena</hi> built ſo near the Sea that they approched within Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot thereof; The mouth of the Harbor was within
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56659:97"/>
three Miles Weſt of the Town, into which they entred about four in the afternoon without the leaſt reſiſtance; In the evening they landed toward the Harbors mouth under their L. General <hi>Cartile,</hi> marching ſilently by the Shore till within two Mile of the Town, when they were met with about an hundred Horſemen, who taking the Alarm upon the firſt Volley of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhot, retired back to the Town; At which inſtant ſome great Guns being diſcharged they underſtood that according to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement the night before, their Vice-Admiral and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captains had in divers Pinnaces and Boats attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the little Fort at the entrance of the Haven, but to little purpoſe ſince it was very ſtrong, and the narrow entrance chain'd over, only it gave an Alarm to the other ſide of the Haven a mile and half from the place where they were; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops now marching within half a Mile of the Town, the paſſage grew narrow, being not above 50 paces broad having the Main Sea on one ſide and the Haven on the other, and was fortified quite over with a Stone Wall and a Ditch behind with flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all along, a way only being left unwalled for Horſe or Carriages to paſs through, which yet was Barricado'd with Barrels fill'd with Earth all along; It had ſix great Guns which were diſcharged on their Front at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; There were likewiſe two great Gallies brought near the Shoar planted with eleven peices of Ordnance which ſhot croſs the way; With three or four hundred ſmall ſhot, and upon the Land, three hundred Muſkets and Pikes more for guarding this Streight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming on, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſpared not for ſmall and great ſhot, but the I. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-taking the advantage of the darkneſs of the morning before Sun-riſe, approached by the Sea Shoar according to his expreſs direction the night before, where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being ſowewhat fallen, moſt of their ſhot was in vain; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were forbid ſhooting till they came to the Wall, and coming to the Barricado of Wine Butts, they inſtantly fell on, throwing down the Barrels, and falling in briſkly both with their Swords and Pikes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56659:98"/>
even at their very faces, after their Muſkets had given their firſt Volley; So that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were driven from the place, and purſued into the Town without giving them any breathing time till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got to the Market place, though they ſometimes made head to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; And were forced to leave them poſſeſſion of the Town, flying into the Countrey to their Wives and Families whom they had ſent away before. They had raiſed handſome Barricadoes of Earth at every Streets end intrenched about, in entring which ſome ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was made, but they were all ſoon diſperſt, few being either wounded or ſlain; They had planted many <hi>Indians</hi> with Bows in places of advantage, their Arrows being Poyſoned to ſuch a height that if they did but break the Skin, the wound was uſually mortal, they ſlew ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> herewith, and with Spikes a foot and half long faſtened in the ground and Impoyſoned, of which they had planted a vaſt number in the common way, but they marching by the Sea Shore happily eſcaped the greateſt part of them; They took <hi>Alonzo Bravo</hi> the Chief Commander of the Barricadoe Priſoner, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utterly routed the reſt, continued in the Town ſix weeks, the Mortality aforementioned ſtill continuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them called by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a Calenture, and imputed by them to the Air of the twilight called <hi>La Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi> which they affirm mortally infects all who are then abroad except the natural <hi>Indians</hi> of the Countrey, and that thoſe who were on the Watch were hereby ſubject to this infection.</p>
               <p>The inconvenience of this ſickneſs hindred them from proſecuting their deſign of going to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and ſo over-land to <hi>Panama</hi> in hope of gaining ſufficient Treaſure to recompence their tedious Travels, which being found impracticable, they were reſolved to return home without attempting further that way: One day while they were there, the Centinel placed upon the Church Steeple diſcovered two ſmall Barks at Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſeveral Captains and Sea-men got aboard two ſmall Pinnaces in hope to ſeize them before they got nigh the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56659:98"/>
Shoar, or had notice from Land of their being in the Town, but notwithſtanding their utmoſt diligence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had given them a ſign, ſo that upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Pinnaces they ran aſhoar and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Buſhes among other <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them notice of their danger; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeeing the Barks empty, raſhly went aboard, and ſtanding openly on the Deck, were ſuddenly ſhot at by a Company of <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Hedges, whereby Captain <hi>Varney</hi> was ſlain on the place, and Captain <hi>Moon</hi> died a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, four or five more being hurt; So that not having Men enough to fight aſhoar, moſt of them being Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men unarmed, ſince they hoped to have taken the Barks with their great Guns, they were forced to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecting any thing, though they might eaſily have taken them, had they reacht them before they came ſo nigh the Shoar.</p>
               <p>During their ſtay here (as formerly at St. <hi>Domingo</hi>) ſeveral kindneſſes paſſed between them and the Town, as feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, viſiting and the like; Among others the Governour of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> with the Biſhop and ſeveral other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came to ſee the General; They had burnt ſome part of the City before they could make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> agree about ranſoming it, but at laſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one hundred and ten thouſand Duckets (each five ſhillings ſix pence ſterling) to ſpare the reſt; So that though not half ſo big as St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> yet they payed a far greater Ranſom, as being of far more importance for its excellent Harbor, and ſcituation for the Trade of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and inhabited with far richer Merchants; The other being chiefly filled with Lawyers and Gentlemen, it being the higheſt Court of Law and Juſtice for all thoſe Iſlands and the Continent alſo; Their having notice of the coming of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> twenty days before from St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> cauſed them to be ſo well fortified and prepared, and had carried away all their Treaſure and rich goods; Upon paying the Sum agreed they left the Town, but drew ſome of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into the Priory or Abbey a quarter of a Mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56659:99"/>
near the Harbor, walled with Stone; telling the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, That this was yet their own, and not comprehended in the Compoſition lately made;</hi> who being ſenſible of this defect, offered to contract for ſecuring that and the Block-houſe likewiſe; agreeing to pay a thouſand Crowns for the Abbey, but pleaded they were not able to give ſo much for the other having done their utmoſt, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> undermined the <hi>Block-houſe,</hi> and blew it up with Gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Mean while the whole Fleet fell down to the mouth of the Harbor, furniſhing themſelves with freſh Water from a great Well in an Iſland there by, which is very pleaſant, abounding with Orange Trees, and ſeveral other choice fruits, ſet in ſuch exact order for Walks, that the whole Iſle, being about three Miles round, is all made into Gardens and Orchards; After ſix weeks aboad at <hi>Carthagena</hi> they put to Sea <hi>March</hi> 31. 1586. and two days after a great Ship taken at St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and called by them, <hi>The New-years Gift,</hi> laden with great Guns, Hides and other plunder, ſprung a great Leak, and in the night loſt Company of the Fleet; Being miſs'd next morning the General doubting ſome misfortune, ſent and found her out, but in great extremity, all her Men being tyred with pumping and the <hi>Talbot</hi> Bark, who happily ſtayed with her was ready to take out her Men and leave her; Whereupon they all returned to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> ſtaying there eight or ten days longer to unload her, and diſpoſe her Men and Goods in another Ship, and then going once more to Sea, directed their Courſe toward <hi>Cape St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> being the Eaſt part of <hi>Cuba,</hi> where they arrived <hi>April</hi> 27. and parting thence toward the <hi>Havana,</hi> after 14 days they were forced back again, and being in much want of Water, found a ſufficient ſupply of Rain-water (newly fallen as they judged) in the Pits and Marſhy ground near the Sea ſide, the General being as diligent as the meaneſt in making neceſſary proviſion here as well as elſewhere, and was much aſſiſted in his Affairs by the prudent Councels and performances of L. General <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile.</hi> Three days being ſpent in watering the Fleet, they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56659:99"/>
departed a ſecond time for <hi>Cape St. Anthony May</hi> 13. and ſailing along in ſight of the Coaſt of <hi>Florida, May</hi> 28. they perceived a place like a Beacon on the Shoar, about 30 degrees North Latitude; upon which manning their Pinnaces, and coming near, they landed and marched up along the River ſide, General <hi>Drake</hi> himſelf command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and perceived a Fort newly built by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> on the other ſide the River over againſt them, and about a Mile above was a little Town or Village of Wooden Houſes without Walls; They preſently prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their great Guns to batter down the Fort, and the firſt ſhot ſtruck through their Enſign, as they heard by a <hi>Frenchman</hi> who came to them from the Enemy; Another ſhot ſtruck the foot of the Fort, which was all of maſſy Timber like Maſts of Ships; It was reſolved that night to paſs the River with four Companys and aſſault it, but the L. General going in a Skiff with ſix Captains more well armed to make diſcovery, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking their whole Force had been come, took the Alarm, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forſook the Fort after having diſcharged a few Peices.</p>
               <p>The L. General being returned without knowing they were gone; Immediately a <hi>French</hi> Piper who had been their Priſoner, came Piping to them in a little Boat, and being called by the Guard, told them before he went aſhoar what he was, &amp; that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were gone from the Fort, offering either to put himſelf into their hands or to return back and direct thoſe that would go, to the Fort; Whereupon the General L. General and ſome Captains in their Skiffs, accompanied with three Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces furniſht with Souldiers, went over toward the Fort; At their approach ſome of the Enemy bolder than the reſt ſtaying behind, ſhot two pieces of Ordnance at them, but they went aſhoar, and entred the place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding any man there. When day appeared they ſaw it was built all of Timber, the Walls being only whole bodies of Trees placed cloſe together like pales, not having yet made a ditch, nor furniſhed it, ſo that they had no reaſon to keep it being ſo ſubject both to fire and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56659:100"/>
aſſaults; The platform for their Guns was the bodies of long Pine-trees whereof they have plenty, laid Croſs each other, and filled up with Earth; They found there 14 Great Braſs Guns, and a Cheſt lockt, wherein was about two thouſand pound ſterling thought to be the Kings for payment of the Souldiers who were about 150 men; The Fort thus won, (which they called St. <hi>Johns</hi> Fort) they deſigned to go to the Town by land but were prevented by the Rivers and broken ground, therefore imbarking again they Sailed thither upon the River called as well as the Town St. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> Coming toward Land, ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> appeared and gave them a few Shot but preſently withdrew, and in their flight the Sergeant Major finding a Horſe ready Sadled and Bridled, mounted him and followed the Chaſe before the reſt, when ſuddenly from behind a Buſh he was ſhot through the head, wherewith falling, two or three <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> more came in and ſtabbed him with their Swords and Daggers into the body in three or four places before any could come near to reſcue him, whoſe death was much lamented.</p>
               <p>They underſtood that in this Town of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the King maintained an 150 Souldiers, and at St. <hi>Helena</hi> 12 Leagues farther North 150 more, only to ſecure thoſe Coaſts from being inhabited by other Nations; The Governor was the Marqueſs <hi>Pedro Melender,</hi> who had command of both places, and yet ran away from them with the firſt; They here reſolved to attempt St. <hi>Helena,</hi> and to find out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inhabiting <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>June</hi> 9. Obſerving a very great Fire aſhoar the General ſent his Skiff to the place and found ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent thither by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> the year before, and one coming aboard gave them directions where to find a good Harbor; The General ſent hence a Letter to Sir <hi>Ralph Lane</hi> Governor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> who was then at his Fort about ſix Leagues from the Road in an Iſland called <hi>Roanoac,</hi> from whence he ſent them ſupplies of all they wanted, and next day Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> and ſome of his Company came aboard, and the General with conſent
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56659:100"/>
of his Captains made him two Propoſals; Either to leave a Ship, Pinnace or certain Boats with ſufficient Maſters, Marriners and a months proviſion, to ſtay and make diſcovery of the Countrey and the Coaſts, and likewiſe ſo much Victuals as might ſuffice to bring them all home being 103 Perſons, if they thought fit afterward; Or elſe if they judged they had already made ſufficient diſcovery and deſired to return into <hi>England</hi> he would give them paſſage; But they being willing to ſtay, thankfully accepted his firſt offer, and the Ship was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly received into their charge by ſome of Mr. <hi>Lanes</hi> Company whom he put aboard her, but before they had received the Proviſions allotted them, there roſe a very dangerous ſtorm which laſted three days and drove many of their Ships from their Anchors, and ſome were forced to Sea, among which the Ship appointed for Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> was forced ſo far to avoid the Coaſt that they never ſaw her again till they came to <hi>England,</hi> many of their Pinnaces and ſmall Boats being loſt in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, the General offered Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> another Ship, but not much fit for their purpoſe, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be brought into Harbor, nor the General not thinking fit to ſpare ſo much proviſions as he intended at firſt; So that upon conſultation among themſelves Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> and the reſt of his Company deſired the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral under their hands to give them paſſage for <hi>England,</hi> which being granted, and the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent for out of the Countrey and Shipt, they left that Coaſt <hi>June</hi> 18. and arrived ſafely at <hi>Plymouth July</hi> 28. following; The Purchaſe of this Voyage was valued at threeſcore thouſand Pound, whereof thoſe who went the Voyage were to have twenty thouſand, amounting to about ſix pounds to the meaneſt man, and the other forty was paid to the Adventurers; They loſt about 750 men, whereof eight were Captains, four Lieutenants, and eight Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; They got about 240 Great Guns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of above 200 were Braſs, and ſo happily ended their Voyage.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> of that Age foretold long before that this ſhould prove a <hi>Wonderful year,</hi> and the Climacterick of the World, which was in ſome meaſure accompliſhed in that admirable deliverance of <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Invaſion.

               <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> having notice of theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preparations, after ſolemn Faſting and Prayers to God for deliverance from her Mighty Adverſarys provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all diligence as ſtrong a Fleet as ſhe could, with all things neceſſary for defence, and having a diſcerning judgment of mens abilities, ſhe aſſigned the fitteſt to every office; Committing the Command of her Navy to <hi>Charles Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham</hi> Lord High Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conſtituting the renowned Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> her Vice Admiral, whom ſhe ſent to the Weſt parts of <hi>England;</hi> And for guarding the Narrow Seas the Lord <hi>Seymor</hi> was appointed to lye on the Coaſts of the Low-Countreys with 40 Ships to watch the Prince of <hi>Parma;</hi> She then ordered the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom to be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and muſtered under the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> twenty thouſand whereof were diſpoſed for the Guard of the Southern Coaſts; Beſides whom ſhe had two Armys more one of a thouſand Horſe and twenty thouſand foot incamped at <hi>Tilbury</hi> near the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, where the Enemy certainly deſigned to come; The other of thirty four thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe under the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> for a Guard to the Queens Perſon; She likewiſe fortified and manned all the places which were commodious for the Enemy to land at as <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, <hi>Falmouth, Plymouth, Portland,</hi> the <hi>Iſle of Wight, Portſmouth,</hi> the open Coaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> called the <hi>Downs,</hi> the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, <hi>Harwich, Yarmouth, Hull,</hi> and other places, with command that the Trained Bands throughout the Coaſt ſhires ſhould be ready to prevent the Enemies Landing, but if they ſhould Land, then to deſtroy all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey therebout, that the Enemy might have nothing wherewith to ſubſiſt but what they brought with them, that they ſhould amuſe them with continual Alarms, but not venture a Battle till they had ſufficient Force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them.</p>
               <p>Yet amidſt theſe Proviſions for War on both ſides, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretended ſtill to Peace, and by the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> a Treaty was propoſed to that purpoſe, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56659:102"/>
Commiſſioners on each Party met in Tents near <hi>Oſtend</hi> which was then in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> The Queen demanded, <hi>That there might an abſolute ſuſpenſion of Arms, and a preſent Truce, ſince ſhe much ſuſpected the</hi> Spaniards <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual preparations; That for the ſecurity of</hi> England <hi>that great Army of Forreign Souldiers might be drawn out of the</hi> Low Countreys; <hi>That the Money ſhe had lent the States, and which the King of</hi> Spain <hi>promiſed to reſtore, might be paid; That the</hi> Netherlands <hi>might enjoy their ancient rights and Priviledges, and not be governed by a ſtranger, but, a Native Prince; That they might have freedom in Religion, and laſtly that the Articles of Pacification of</hi> Gaunt, <hi>and the reſt might be obſerved; Which things being granted, ſhe would upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Terms deliver up thoſe Towns in the</hi> Netherlands <hi>now in her poſſeſſion, and make it appear that ſhe had hitherto kept them not for her own advantage but the neceſſary defence of thoſe Countreys.</hi> To this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> replyed, <hi>That as to their preparations at Sea they aſſured them it no way concerned</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>That the King would not ſend away his Souldiers till the</hi> Netherlands <hi>had abſolutely ſubmitted to him; That their Privilidges did no way concern the Queen, neither ought ſhe to preſcribe Law to a King; That as to Religion he would only allow the ſame freedom as to the other Citys that had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; And as for the Money expended about the Towns, the King of</hi> Spain <hi>might as well demand of her the Millions he had expended in the</hi> Low Countrey <hi>War ſince ſhe had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and protected the Revolters;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> one of the Commiſſioners was ſent to expoſtulate mildly with the D. of <hi>Parma</hi> about ſome Libels publiſhed againſt her, who denied his having any knowledg thereof, proteſting <hi>That he had ſo much reſpect for the Q. of</hi> England, <hi>that he honoured her in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and had perſwaded the King to condeſcend to this Treaty of Peace, which would be more advantagious to the</hi> Englſh <hi>than themſelves; For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>be overcome they will ſoon recover their loſs; But if you be defeated your Kingdom is utterly undone and all loſt;</hi> To which <hi>Dale</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; <hi>Our Queen is ſufficiently provided to defend her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and your own wiſdom will ſatisfy you that a Kingdom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56659:103"/>
cannot be loſt with the fortune of one Battell, ſince the K. of</hi> Spain <hi>after ſo long a War is not able to recover his ancient inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the</hi> Netherlands; <hi>Be it ſo</hi> (ſaid the Prince) <hi>theſe things are in the hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is recorded that when the Commiſſioners firſt met about the Treaty one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſked in what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they ſhould Treat, another thinking to affront the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaid, <hi>We were beſt treat in</hi> French <hi>ſince your Miſtreſs is Queen of</hi> France, To which Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> ſmartly replyed, <hi>Nay then pray let it be in</hi> Hebrew, <hi>for your Maſter calls himſelf King of</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>After the Commiſſioners had long debated matters without concluding any thing till at length the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet came in view of <hi>England</hi> and the thundring of the great Guns was heard from Sea; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners were thereby much ſtartled having no hoſtages for their ſafe return, but they received a ſafe conduct from the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> (who in the mean time had drawn down all his Forces to the Sea-coaſt) and ſo they were conducted to the Borders near <hi>Callice;</hi> And thus this Treaty was utterly ineffectual, begun by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> as was thought to divert the coming of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, &amp; continued by them to ſurprize the <hi>Engliſh</hi> unprovided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 29. 1588. This <hi>Invincible Armado</hi> ſo named by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (which was preparing full five years,) ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the River <hi>Tayo</hi> toward the <hi>Groin</hi> in <hi>Gallizia</hi> the deſigned Rendevouz as neareſt <hi>England,</hi> but a ſudden Tempeſt drove the Admiral the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> back again, and eight of his Ships being diſperſed on the Seas had their Maſts blown over board, and three <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Gallies were driven on the Coaſt of <hi>Bayon</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where by the valour of <hi>David Gwin</hi> with the aſſiſtance of other <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlaves they were delivered into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> by killing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aboard, among whom <hi>Don Diego de Mondrana</hi> was one. About this time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral and Vice-Admiral <hi>Drake</hi> having in all about an hundred Ships, whereof 15 were Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and nine Gentlemen Volunteers of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> upon certain notice that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was ready to Sail,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56659:103"/>
reſolved to go and fight them by the way, but meeting with this ſtorm they were forced back again to recruit, only ſome of their Scouts diſcovered ſome diſperſed <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ships, who before they could reach them veered about to the <hi>Groin</hi> to the reſt of the Fleet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy being new rigged and ſupplyed, <hi>July</hi> 11. with much aſſurance they entred the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Channel, where caſting Anchor they ſent diſpatches to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> of their Arrival. <hi>July</hi> 20. about Noon this dreadful Fleet was deſcried by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with much ſurprize; They appeared like lofty Towers in form of an half Moon, the horns whereof ſtretched above ſeven Mile wide, (the Ocean ſeeming to groan under them) ſailing ſlowly toward <hi>Plymouth; July</hi> 21. the Lord Admiral ſending a Pinnace called the <hi>Defiance</hi> before, to denounce War by diſcharging her Ordnance, himſelf followed in the <hi>Ark-Royal,</hi> and fell with much fury upon one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships; Vice-Admiral <hi>Drake, Hawkins</hi> and <hi>Frobiſher</hi> coming up ſoon after, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violently upon the hindmoſt Squadron of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my commanded by <hi>Rechalde,</hi> who endeavoured to keep his Ships from flying, but being himſelf made at length unſerviceable, they were all forc't to ſecure themſelves in the Main Fleet.</p>
               <p>The D. of <hi>Medina</hi> having rallied his Navy diſperſt by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> kept on his intended courſe toward <hi>Callice,</hi> finding much inconvenience in his large high Ships, as not able to defend themſelves againſt the brisk Attacks of the ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigots, who for two hours main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very hot fight with them; In this firſt days en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter two great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships were diſabled; and falling into a Roundel, the ſtrongeſt walling in the reſt, they made a flying retreat to <hi>Callice;</hi> yet in the hurry a great Gallion commanded by <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much battered, fell foul on another Ship, and was ſo diſabled that ſhe was left by the reſt, and the Lord Admiral, night coming on, ſuppoſing ſhe had neither Souldiers nor Mariners aboard paſſed by her; <hi>July</hi> 22. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> eſpied her and ſent forth a Pinnace to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56659:104"/>
command her to yield, otherwiſe his Bullets would force her, <hi>Valdez</hi> to aſſert his credit and pretend to valour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>That they were four hundred and fifty ſtrong, that he himſelf was</hi> Don Pedro, <hi>and ſtood much upon his honour;</hi> and thereupon propounded ſeveral conditions upon which he was willing to yield; But the Vice-Admiral replyed, <hi>That he had no leiſure to parley, but if he thought fit inſtantly to yield he might, if not he ſhould ſoon find that</hi> Drake <hi>was no Coward; Pedro</hi> hearing it was <hi>Drake</hi> whoſe name was ſo terrible to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> preſently yielded, and with 46 of his Attendants came aboard Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his Ship, where giving him the Solemn <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Congee, he proteſted, <hi>That they were all reſolved to have died fighting had they not fallen into his hands whoſe Felicity and Valour was ſo great that</hi> Mars <hi>the God of War, and</hi> Neptune <hi>the God of the Sea ſeemed to wait upon all his attempts, and whoſe noble and generous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward the vanquiſhed had been oft experienced by his Foes;</hi> Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to requite theſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Complements with real <hi>Engliſh</hi> kindneſs, ſet him at his own Table and lodged him in his own Cabin, ſending the reſt of his Company to <hi>Plymouth; Drakes</hi> Souldiers were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with the plunder of this Ship, wherein they found fifty five Thouſand Ducats of Gold which they merrily ſhared amongſt them; The ſame day the Ship of Vice-Admiral <hi>De Oquondo</hi> fell on fire, and the upper part only being burnt, fell into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was brought with the ſcorcht <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Plymouth. July</hi> 23. They came juſt againſt <hi>Portland,</hi> when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> falling upon them with the utmoſt violence, a very ſharp fight enſued, wherein beſides other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damages ſuſtained by the Enemy a great <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship with ſome other ſmaller Veſſels were taken, and the Adverſary was again forced into a Roundel to ſecure their weak and battered Ships; The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhot gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flew over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without hurt, only <hi>Cock</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> died with honour in the midſt of his Enemies in a little Ship of his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 24. An encounter happened between four great <hi>Galliaſſes</hi> with Oars, and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> who galled the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56659:104"/>
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeverely with their Chain-ſhot wherewith they cut their Tackle to their great detriment; But the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> wanting Powder which they had ſpent ſo freely, the L Admiral ſent ſome ſmall Ships for ſupply, and in the mean time after Conſultation it was reſolved, that the Fleet ſhould be divided into four Squadrons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by four able Captains, whereof the L. Admiral in the <hi>Ark-Royal</hi> was Chief, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> the ſecond; Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> the third, and Capt. <hi>Frobiſher</hi> the fourth. <hi>July</hi> 25. being St. <hi>James</hi>'s day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came as far as the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where they were again aſſaulted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> diſcharging their broad ſides at each other not above an hundred and twenty yards aſunder, and after a long Ingagement the great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooden Caſtles were ſo ſorely battered, that they were again forced into their former poſture for their ſecurity; <hi>July</hi> 26. the L. Admiral to incourage his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captains, knighted the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and <hi>Sheffeild, Roger Townſend, John Hawkins, Martin Frobiſher</hi> &amp; others; After which it was reſolved not to aſſail the Enemy any more till they came into the Channel between <hi>Callice</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> where the L. <hi>Seymour,</hi> and Sir <hi>Will. Winter</hi> waited for their approach, who in a ſhort time ſailing forward were ſo far from affrighting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the name of <hi>Invincible,</hi> that ſeveral brave young Gentlemen at their own charges hired Ships to defend their Countrey, and joyned the Fleet in great numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 27. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy came over againſt <hi>Dover,</hi> anchoring before <hi>Callice,</hi> intending to joyn the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Forces at <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> followed ſo near, that they were within Muſket-ſhot, and being now all joyned conſiſted of 140 Sail, all able nimble Ships; Yet not above 15 of them ſuſtained the brunt of the day. From hence the D. of <hi>Medina</hi> ſent to the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> to haſten his Succours, who did his utmoſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his deſire, he himſelf having his thoughts fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, as ſome falſe Prophet had foretold him; but his flat-bottom'd Boats for the Channel were leaky, his proviſions were unready, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56659:105"/>
his Mariners deſerted him; There were likewiſe ſeveral <hi>Nolland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> Men of War watching before the Havens of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> ſo well provided, that though he was a very experienced Commander he durſt not put to Sea unleſs he ſhould willingly deſtroy himſelf and his Men.</p>
               <p>But the felicity of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Fortune prevented his diligence, and the credulous hope of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> For by her command next day after they had caſt Anchor, the L. Admiral filled eight of his worſt Ships with Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, Pitch, Roſin, Brimſtone, and other combuſtible matter, and charged their great Guns with Bullets, Stones, Chains, and the like Inſtruments of Death, and all the Men being taken out, <hi>Sunday July</hi> 28. at two in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were let drive with the Wind and Tyde (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guidance of C. <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Prowſe</hi>) amongſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet; When the Pilots returning, and the Trains taking fire, they received ſuch a dreadful Thunder-clap in that dead time of the night by theſe Fire-ſhips, that they were extremely affrighted and amazed, doubting their whole Fleet would have been fired, and to avoid the danger, cut their Cables aſunder, and hoiſing Sail, drove at random into the Sea, in which horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one great Galliaſs fell upon another, and running aground was ſet upon by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and taken, being manned with four hundred Souldiers, three hundred Slaves, and having in her fifty thouſand Duckets of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings Treaſure, which all fell into the hands of the <hi>Engilſh</hi> as a reward for their Valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 29. After this miſerable diſaſter wherein many of their Ships were driven into the Northern Ocean, and others on the Coaſts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ranging themſelves in the beſt order they could, approached over againſt <hi>Graveling,</hi> but were again prevented by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> from getting any ſupply from <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and in the mean time Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and ſeveral other Captains played continually upon them, and tore many of their Ships ſo dreadfully, that the Water entred on all ſides; And ſome flying for relief toward <hi>Oſtend</hi> were again ſhot
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56659:105"/>
through and through by the <hi>Zealanders.</hi> In this Battel the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt one great Gallion, and four other great Ships, two whereof were taken by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> finding worſe welcom to <hi>England</hi> than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, were now willing to get cloſe together, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to offend their Enemies, but defend themſelves; and to prevent the Prince of <hi>Parma's</hi> aſſiſtance, the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet conſiſting of 35 Ships, furniſhed with able Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and twelve hundred old Souldiers, was ordered to ſtop up the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Havens, and hinder his coming forth. <hi>July</hi> 31. betimes in the morning the Northweſt wind blew hard, &amp; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet endeavoured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to recover the Channel again, but were driven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Zealand,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who had hitherto followed them very cloſe gave over the chaſe, becauſe they judged them near their utter ruine, ſince they muſt needs run a ground upon thoſe ſands and ſhallows, but the wind ſuddenly turning Weſt, they got clear of them, and that evening calling a Council, they reſolved to return into <hi>Spain</hi> by the Northern Ocean, ſince they wanted many neceſſaries eſpecially great ſhot, and their ſhips were miſerably torn, and there was no hope of the Prince of <hi>Parma's</hi> coming out with his Fleet.</p>
               <p>In purſuance whereof having now got Sea Room for their huge Bodied Bulks, they ſpread their Sails, and made away as faſt as Wind and Water would carry them, more fearing the ſmall Fleet and Forces of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than valuing the Honour of their Commanders, or their <hi>Invincible Armado;</hi> They directed their courſe Northward, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral followed them leſt they ſhould put into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but they paſſed by, and though it was generally thought they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, yet they at length betook themſelves to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute flight, and leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> on the Weſt, Sailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> unadviſedly venturing their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and battered bottoms in thoſe black and dangerous Seas; The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> was much blamed as if out of favour to Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> he had wilfully neglected this opportunity, who (to ſatisfy the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) puniſhed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56659:106"/>
ſome of the Purveyors, yet ſecretly ſcoffing at the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> inſolency, who boaſted that they carried aſſured Victory whereſoever they went, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never durſt look them in the face.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> Sailing round <hi>Scotland and Ireland,</hi> at laſt arrived ſafely in <hi>Spain,</hi> where for his welcome he was depoſed from all authority, forbid to come to Court, and commanded to live private; The reſt of the Ships being about 40, fell nearer the Coaſt of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where many of them periſhed, and among others a great Galliaſs and two other <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships of gleat burden, beſides 38 more with moſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in them, ſuch as got off were driven by a ſtrong Weſt Wind into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel and were taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> others by the <hi>Rochellers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Newhaven</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> ſo that of one hundred thirty four Ships that Sailed out of <hi>Liſbon</hi> only 53 return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Spain;</hi> Of the four Galliaſſes of <hi>Naples</hi> but one; Of the four Gallions of <hi>Portugal</hi> but one; Of the 91 Great Hulks from divers Provinces only 33 returned, 58 being loſt. In ſhort they loſt in this Voyage 81 Ships, thirteen thouſand five hundred Souldiers, and above two thouſand taken Priſoners in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> To concluded there was no Noble or Honourable Family in all <hi>Spain</hi> which in this expedition loſt not a Son, Brother, or Kinſman; And thus this <hi>Armando</hi> which had been ſo many years in preparing with vaſt expences was in one month many times aſſaulted, and at length wholly defeated with the ſlaughter of ſo many of their men not one hundred of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor one ſmall Ship taken or loſt but only that of <hi>Cooks;</hi> And having traverſed round all <hi>Brittain</hi> by <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> moſt grievouſly toſſed and very much diſtreſſed and waſted by Storms, wrecks and all kind of miſerys, at length the remainder came lamely home with perpetual ſhame and diſhonour, and to the Everlaſting honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name, who by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven upon the courage and conduct of the Q. and her valiant Commanders (among whom our r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
